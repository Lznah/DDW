# Visualizations:

## green.png and community_greenone.png
It shows that there is a big community, colored in green color. Other are too little with coverage usually around 0.2 % out of all nodes. Maybe if I chose different communities recognition algorithm, I would get better results. Now it looks like it shows only communities of a single movie.

## Issues:
The biggest issue was Gephi. I literally don't know how to use it and I was not able to find funcionalities for better visualizations. Also, graphs very to big to be generated via graphviz and I was surprised how much time it took, to render a graph from 16K nodes.
I had another issue during the import with datatypes, which can be seen in results/warning.png.

## Future work:
Definitely better visualizations.
