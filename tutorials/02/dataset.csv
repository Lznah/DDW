I am dissatisfied with the current outcome of a dispute that was initiated with Discover Card regarding a single transaction that occurred on XXXX/XXXX/2015 in the amount of {$280.00}. I have corresponded with Discover Card at least four times since XXXX/XXXX/2015 ( which I have enclosed as an attachment to this complaint ). I believe that the credit card issuer has violated consumer protection laws by failing to implement the Special Rule for Credit Card Purchase protection despite overwhelming paperwork evidence submitted by me that shows the merchant has conducted business in bad faith less favorable to the consumer. I have sustained a monetary loss as a result of merchants bad faith and intent. I have patiently utilized the internal Discover Card dispute process over the past three months with the credit card issuer always favoring the merchant ; I have repeatedly submitted irrefutable paperwork evidence that has shown that the merchant has conducted business in bad faith. I have tried in good faith to address my complaint with the merchant and Discover Card but believe that I will not receive a favorable outcome.On XX/XX/18 an item showed up on my credit report that had previously been removed under a different collection agency based on a burden of proof that the debt even existed which it did not. It would appear that this debt was then sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. These practices are highly illegal. I demand that this be removed from my report immediately.Saw on my credit report that there is a collection for {$970.00} but I don't know what it is for since I did not incur this debt. The first collection company said they closed the account and returned the account to their client XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX So what does that mean? It is not my debt.Capital one auto finacing XX/XX/2018 unknown inquiring on credit report.I own a small trucking company. One of my trucks needed a repair. I hired a mechanic to do the repair on XX/XX/XXXX. He told us he installed new batteries and a new starter on the truck. The mechanic stated his work was guaranteed and I paid him with my TD Bank XXXX credit card {$2300.00} for this repair. When my driver went to start the truck for work the next day, the truck did not work/start again. We tried calling/texting mechanic to let him know the truck was not working even though the previous day he said he fixed the truck. I have the texts and phone records showing we were reaching out to the mechanic with no response from him. I had to hire another mechanic to fix truck again and found out the parts put in my truck by the first mechanic were wrong. I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX for the above transaction with my TD Bank XXXX credit card. Even though I paid the first mechanic {$2300.00}, my dispute amount was for only {$1300.00} because that amount is for the wrong parts. The credit card company requested proof of records and a second estimate for work done on truck. I overnighted a package on XX/XX/XXXX to the credit card company. Within a day or two that is when the dispute department requested a second estimate. The dispute department stated I had only until XX/XX/XXXX to submit the second estimate documentation. So I faxed the second estimate on XX/XX/XXXX which was the same date the dispute department received my overnight package. When I called to followup on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX the dispute department stated they never received second estimate needed for dispute, even though I had a fax confirmation transmission stating the fax was sent. So I sent fax again onXX/XX/XXXX ( which was the deadline for this documentation ) and received fax confirmation sheet stating the fax was sent. TD Bank XXXX credit card stated they never received second estimate in time and they closed my dispute. So even though I did everything they requested in the time they wanted because of the failure on their end with not receiving fax ( even though I have proof ), my company lost when I should be protected by the " XXXX '' logo.XX/XX/XXXX, I was working as a XXXX in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a result of a series of legislation called Act 10, I was forced to take a cut in take home pay of almost XXXX per month. I immediately began trying to work with XXXX XXXX XXXX to modify my home loan into something affordable. I was told that I had to be 45 days behind in order to start a modification process, so I allowed myself to fall behind to start the process ( I was running about 29 days late prior ). After 3 years of attempting to work with them, including lost paperwork, inaccurate claims ( ie home vacant when it was n't ), and changes in case workers, etc I finally contacted my local State Representative who managed to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to work with me. XX/XX/XXXX, I finally had a modification offer but it modified my home to over {$170000.00}. My home is only worth about {$69000.00}. When I asked about modifying it down to what it was worth, I was told to sign the modification and then XXXX XXXX XXXX would work on adjusting the modification down to its value. The only reason the amount was so high was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX taking over 3 years to modify my mortgage and their ineptitude with the process. XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered a job in XXXX, ND which I then accepted. My preference at that time, would have been to have to modification at the value of my home and then to rent the home out. As XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to honor their earlier agreement of renegotiating the modification down to the value of the home, it has now fallen into foreclosure and is vacant. After XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Carrington Mortgage-while in the middle of a modification, in XXXX XXXX, I again attempted the process and was denied any options. When I called to work with the company, I was told, on several occasions, different things. Once I was told to go ahead and short sale it, only to receive a letter later stating that was not possible. I also received a letter stating that I did not qualify for any options. XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from a law firm representing XXXX XXXX XXXX that my foreclosure was being reopened. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached legal work stating the foreclosure was in the 3 month redemption. After contacting both Carrington and XXXX XXXX XXXX over the course of the last 4 months, I have been told each other owns the mortgage, no one has foreclosed, the process has not been started, it has been started, XXXX XXXX XXXX is not allowed to do that, we do n't own the loan, we do own the loan, etc. My last conversation with Carrington stated that they are selling the mortgage effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will not do anything with it, while the attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to move forward with the foreclosure. I have been dealing with this for almost 4 years, with no solution in sight when this should have been completed over 3 years ago. I have attached some of the RMAs, etc and have most paperwork available ( about XXXX pages worth ).I have a public record & Child Support entry that was placed on my credit report and I have been trying for over 12 months to get this entry removed. I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how XXXX, XXXX and Experian verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a XXXX XXXX, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call XXXX back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. All 3 major bureaus refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine.On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Harris and Zide representing XXXX XXXX. The original creditor was XXXX XXXX bank but sold to XXXX funding. The letter stated they were processing a lawsuit to collect the amount of {$950.00} and to contact them immediately. I contacted them and spoke to a representative by the name of XXXX. I informed her of the letter and let her know I wanted to set up arrangements. She asked me what I could pay and I stated {$25.00} a month. She advised me that they could not agree to that amount but I could send the money but that would not stop the lawsuit. I told her I would follow up later. The next day I set up payment arrangements with a guy named XXXX in the amount of {$56.00} a month until the balance is paid off. I asked for the agreement in writing and was informed that I would receive a stipulation with the agreement and to sign and send back. Weeks went by and I followed up on the agreement. By then I made 2 payments. They gave me the run around and said that I should receive it soon. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor 's name was XXXX. She faxed me a written agreement of the payment arrangement. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the stipulation with a different amount owed of over {$1300.00}. This amount was never disclosed to me in any of the previous conversations and it is not the correct balance reported on my credit report. The agreement they sent me stated I owed {$950.00}. I do not deny the balance of {$950.00} but they can not collect on more than what the debt is.XXXX has once again furnished ficticious and derogatory information to lender " XXXX ''. They provided a falsely low credit score and other false information as well, to assure a denial by XXXX, which they did.Complaint against SUNTRUST MORTGAGE in regards to the posting of my monthly payments since taking over my loan servicing on XX/XX/2018. My monthly statements are consistently reflecting 2 months of payments due. I have contacted the mortgage company every month to better understand why this is occurring, as I am submitting my monthly payments well before the XXXX of each month. Initially i received a statement for XXXX reflecting 2 months due for my mortgage ( XXXX & XXXX ). I noted a correspondence that stated my loan was sold at the end of XXXX, but no account information provided by new service provider SUNTRUST. I reached out to SUNTRUST to make an online payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX to maintain my account current. In the XXXX billing statement I understood why system generated the dual payment due as the conversion time being noted. However for the XXXX Billing statement did not understand why still showing 2 payments being due. I contacted SUNTRUST on XX/XX/XXXX and was told my billing cycle was occurring every XXXX of the month, as this was automatically set-up by the system. Additionally I had mailed hard-copy checks this month, as needed to make up an escrow shortage. Understanding this billing cycle I sent my XXXX payment on XX/XX/18 via epay for XXXX XXXX account. I visited the website again on XX/XX/18 only to see my payment not yet posted. XXXX XXXX show funds withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/2018. I spoke to XXXX with customer service and she explained my payment may show deducted from account, but it was probably mailed by XXXX XXXX so has not yet been processed. My XXXX statement has been generated already and is showing 2 payments due! Why is SUNTRUST system deliberating trying to access me with late payment statements?On XX/XX/2015 my son XXXX received a check from Social Security for a settlement on his XXXX claim, since he has no income he does not have a checking account.The plan was to deposit his check in my account and start a new account at another bank. He endorsed the check and i did too, i then deposited the check in the atm at the bank. This procedure take until the next day for the check to clear.I was aware of this and when i looked at my account on XX/XX/2015 there was no deposit and a note was attached to the deposit.I then called the banks help line, where i was given XXXX different excuses why they did n't deposit the check. the first excuse was that my son was not on my account, the second was a teller did not witness him signing the check! This flies in the face of the banks trying the customer to use as many electronic devices as possible. I 'm XXXX years old as of today a veteran who served his country and that was how i was taught how you deal with checks that was before the internet and to big to fail! the lack of this money has caused severe hardship on my family, we are out of food and need to pay our bills! It is my contention that wells fargo acted in bad faith and should be justly punished!I moved to XXXX XXXX last year, but was traveling a lot for work and ended up moving to XXXX XXXX. I wanted to open a credit account to build a strong credit score so when I was buying stuff at XXXX XXXX, I signed up for their credit card system not knowing they had put an outstanding balance of XXXX XXXX This was 8 months ago. I never received the credit card, therefore I still to this day have never used the card and have no idea where it is. Then I started getting calls from 'unknown ' saying I had to pay XXXX $ about 3 months ago, so I thought it was a fraud because they didn't specify where they were coming from. Then more unknown, or random numbers were calling me saying I owe XXXX $ to XXXX XXXX. I explained to them I have no idea why I would owe them that because I never received the card therefore I couldn't go online to pay whatever outstanding balance was on my card because I couldn't sign in without the credit card number and information in the package that was supposed to be delivered to me. My hands are tied. I kept trying to find a number to call back but could never find one. I  finally spoke to someone and just asked if I could pay whatever it is over the phone to settle this not knowing how deeply it affected my credit score. It's clearly a very, very sneaky system. My credit score is now very low because of this and I'm hoping to sign a lease for a new apartment in XXXX. I'm XXXX years old trying to start adulthood in the strongest way possible and this was a serious shock when I saw that my credit score was so low when looking to see what it is so I can find an apartment to call home and start my own life. Please help me.The debt in question was paid in XXXX 2014 and is still being reported to the XXXX gathering agencies as an open collection account. Proof of payment has been provided to the agency and they have failed to respond or correct the reporting. The accounts being reported as a balance owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but the balance was paid to ChexSystems XXXX, who XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX referred the matter to as well, meaning the same account was referred to XXXX ( XXXX ) separate agencies for collections, which I believe is defined as overshadowing.On XXXX/XXXX/2015 my bank account balance with PNC Bank was XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 the bank charged a {$36.00} overdraft fee with no other posted transactions. XXXXXXXXThus, leaving me with XXXX dollars in the bank. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I had XXXX deposits come in and a bill pay go out. I called the bank of PNC to report my account was in the positive when they charged an overdraft fee and after the fee, my account was still in the positive. I spoke to the bank employees and I was told they process bills before deposits, thus putting my account on XXXX in the negative forcing it to go into the negative so they can collect a fee. I told them all the transactions ( as you can see in the screen shot ) are pending as they are posting as of today, and my account was still in the positive and no reason to charge a fee. They refused to return the fee.XXXX addresses are here the I 've never lived in the areasHSBC, I am enclosing a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stating an Account # XXXX from HSBC that is allegedly owned by me. Please verify this account as belonging to me along with date opened, date closed/charged off, date of 1st delinquency and amount. I have no records of this account that they claim has a date of delinquency or charge off of XX/XX/XXXX. I maintain that I have not had an HSBC card since XXXX and this account does not belong to me. Please read the response below from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and verify the accuracy. Thank you : To Whom It May Concern : MrXXXX XXXX is referring to a different account number.

HSBC is the original creditor and I will await their response to this matter. Thank you!I am currently on a HAMP loan that was originated in 2013. Under HAMP I was suppose to receive at {$1000.00} credit each year after 12 consecutive payments are made on time. It is clearly written in my modification documents. Each year after 12 months of consecutive payments, I have called Mr Cooper to request the credit. I have always had automatically payments set up with them so all payments have been on time. They always tell me that I am only eligible after the full 5 years of payments is completed. I am now beyond the 5 years since origination. I have been trying to contact Mr Cooper regarding my incentive credit under the program. Mr Cooper representatives keep saying it will be processed shortly and that I will receive written notice. I have not received anything in over 5 years and have been calling every month or two for status for the last 4 yrs. They refuse to put anything in writing even after numerous request for written confirmation they are processing the incentive credit. Mr Cooper 's website does not have option to send email so that I can receive written response. I have tried to calling Making Homes Affordable counselor for assistance, but they have been unwilling to help, but did tell me that the lender is suppose to give me the credit each year after consecutive 12 monthly payments are made on time, not after 60 months. They also indicated that I should also be eligible for up to {$5000.00} credit if I make 12 consecutive payments on time in the 6th year. I feel like Mr Cooper is is violating the terms of the modification so that they can keep money that funded by the government. I need help please!I received a collection notice and called right away. I figured I had over looked it as we have many medical bills. While on the phone I was told there were XXXX additional, much older than the notice I called about. I paid the one notice and said I needed to look at the date for the other one. One of those were for my adult son and could not be discussed with me ( a separate complaint is being filed ). I called back and left a message to send me a copy of the other bill. I could find one original bill for the oldest of the incidents, but not other notices or attempts to contact us. Though I have paid these, I wanted to make the CFPB aware of the tactics, that I believe are aimed at gaining more interest. Over the year or XXXX these bills have gone without notification or contact until now, they have racked up quite a bit of interest. My son 's bill we are still trying to get verification that it is even his. It is very large and we do have insurance and an FSA account, I see no reason why we would have let them go. One could be over looked, but I find XXXX very suspicious. I just want the company 's business practices looked at more closely.I suffered a work-related injury in XXXX and am now permanently XXXX. My income has dropped substantially in the past 5 years and I am now on a low fixed income. On XXXX separate occasions from XXXX to XXXX I had zero income and had to use my Sams Club card to purchase food, thus running up debt out of necessity. I am currently in the process of attempting to pay down my Sams Club ( Synchrony Bank ) card, and stopped using the card some time ago. I have always made at least minimum payments and have never missed a payment. Despite this, my interest rate has been unilaterally raised three times in the past two years, and is now at 23.15 %. I called a Sams Club account rep today to file a complaint over the phone, because I am never going to be able to pay down this card when I am paying almost {$50.00} a month in interest and can only afford to pay the minimum payment + {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars. They would not work with me, which I expected. In my opinion, Synchrony Bank is taking unfair advantage of recent interest rate hikes to gouge customers, especially those who are financially unable to make substantial monthly payments on their accounts. Therefore I am contacting the CFPB to file a complaint through which I might receive some relief.I had 3 accounts with Chase. They closed my accounts upon review for 3 reasons. Returned payments ( a payment was rejected because I made a payment from a savings account. I was informed previously that I could make payments from the savings account. I was provided misinformation by the company that eventually influenced the closure of my account. Credit limit was too high ( I was granted the credit limit by Chase originally and then months later, they decided the limit was too high and instead of lowering the limit or closing less than all of the accounts, they shut them all down. Again, I was given this limit by the company, only to have the company then say that it was too high and that they were going to remove the accounts. ) Not enough credit history ( again, granted the cards by the company only to have them remove the accounts. ) I addressed the savings account issue with Chase over the phone and confirmed that I could make the payments with a savings account. I clearly had enough credit history to acquire the cards in the first place so there is no cause to claim I didn't have enough credit history. They granted me the credit limits at first, have me the cards, and then at their will, chose that the limit they granted me was too high and this closed the account. Every reason that my account was closed was due to their negligence and I have received the fallout.I am contacting you because I have recently been treated wrongfully by Navient. During my entire tenure with Navient, since they split from XXXX, I have made on-time consecutive payments. As a result, I have always had the waiver eligibility ( XXXX ) of the final 6 payments ( amounting to about {$2000.00} ) waiver notification present for all of my four Stafford loans. My 114th payment should have been my last. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the day after my 114th payment, they removed this benefit without giving a reason. I called them to let them know of the error and they stated, by mail after a week, that I am ineligible because my loan term is less than 10 years. This is untrue, my loan term is exactly 10 years, which satisfies the conditions. They are trying to remove this benefit that I was expecting and was very much looking forward to. They are ruining their reputation ( in my eyes ). Will I need to get an ombudsman ( or even a lawyer ) to fight for reinstatement of this eligibility?I have sent four written request ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) certified to this credit bureau to VALIDATE a debt ( XXXX ..., XXXX ..., XXXX ..., XXXX ) that has been placed on my credit file. This credit bureau has FAILED to validate this request by providing an original consumer contract with my signature on it. According to the FCRA, accounts that are not positively validated by proof must be removed and deleted. This credit bureau has failed to do this more than four times. It has " said '' that they have verified this debt but has only sent an alleged account history. This is not sufficient and does and is a violation by federal law and I fully intend to pursue litigation in accordance with the FCRA to enforce my rights. The accounts need to be validated by original contract or DELETED.Experian continuesto claim they have verified a XXXX account, XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX From XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX and I sued these companies and have a legal settlement from both that they 've requested the accounts removed. Experian refuses to comply.My mortgage services is Residential Credit Solutions. To pay the mortgage only line they charge a minimum {$5.00} fee. Not wanting to pay the fee, I am forced to mail a check every month. the last 3 months, despite mailing the payment in at least 5 days in advance each time, RCS does not process the payment until XXXX+ weeks after the payment has been mailed. They then charge a late fee for receiving the payment after the XXXX of month. They should not be charging a fee to accept an on time payment processed online thorough their website. they claim they are not a bank so there fore they have to use a XXXX party service who charges them fee and the the consumer must pay the fee. they claim they can not control the post office, but it does not take XXXX weeks for mail to arrive to a domestic location. I have now been charged {$140.00} in late fees, plus been forced to pay an addition {$10.00} in online payment feesXX/XX/XXXX On or about XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX Texas was hit by hurricane Harvey, for 8 days it rained flooding the area with 51 inches of rain accumulation, keeping the city locked in place.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, extending a helping hand, I did not retain a copy of that letter. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America on the phone number provided in the letter, asking about the deferred payments for 2 months, the employee took my information said I would be receiving an information package in the mail, received approval dated XX/XX/XXXX, for forbearance, not one word about paying this immediately, it was my understanding and what the original conversation was about deferred, meaning to the end. XX/XX/XXXX, as per Bank of Americas approval I did not pay XX/XX/XXXX {$1200.00}. I received a certified package from Bank of America, stating they were placing my house in foreclosure, I called the as per the letter XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, 3 times no response, was told this package is automatically generated by computer, it is a mistake, to ignore it and throw it away, which I did. XX/XX/XXXX as per Bank of Americas approval, I did not pay XXXX {$1200.00} I also received another certified package from Bank of America, the exact same foreclosure notice as in XX/XX/XXXX. I called as instructed in the package, I was told yes Bank of America is going to foreclose on your property. No matter how many phone calls I made every customer service rep. had a different story, I tried escalating to someone higher, kept getting put off, so I contacted my attorney XXXX & XXXX to get involved, Bank of America was sent notice. XX/XX/XXXX, as per Bank of Americas approval for 2 month deferred payment plan, I made my scheduled payment of {$1200.00}. Bank of America sent a letter to introduce my new account manager I have been making my scheduled payments XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. In late XXXX I received a letter from Bank of America introducing my new dedicated customer relationship manager, I do not recall her name, but called for 6 consecutive weeks to get an audience with her to discuss my account, after 6 weeks of no return calls, I requested a change of new dedicated customer relationship managers, over the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I received no less than 7 letters all introducing my new dedicated customer relationship managers.

How do you offer to lend a helping hand, but not have a plan in place, then 4 months latter the plan has hurt the very ones it was advertised, to help. I was not getting any answers by calling Bank of America, after 4 months of being in the dark, receiving threatening letters from Bank of America, I decided I would go to the branch I personally go to and make my mortgage payment for the past 15 years to speak in person. I have a service dog, I went into the branch, spoke with an agent, yes I did make the statement we need to get to the bottom of this, so we are stayimg here until this gets resolved, less than a month later, I received a certified letter from Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, advising me they filed criminal trespassing complaint against me. I have personally hand delivered my payment each month for 17 years, I do not trust the internet, nor the USPS, so how can I make my payments. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXI have a paid and satisfied Ga tax state lien that has been released on XX/XX/2017 from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have submitted the information over to all credit bureaus, XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax. All bureaus besides Equifax have released and removed the lien from my credit report. I have called Equifax on several occasions to se reason on why they wont remove this lien from my report.Sent Equifax multiple letter on this account and it shows on my credit report that the monthly payment is {$1500.00}We have been trying to work a short sale with SPS. They initially did an external value which didn't show the foundation that is collapsing. We submitted a value dispute and received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they agree with our value dispute {$22000.00}. SPS took so long to complete the decision process so that we lost the buyer. Based on their letter that they would take {$22000.00} we relisted the home to get them the required NET they require if the value was {$22000.00}. This put us at a purchase price of {$23000.00}. SPS has held the file for MONTHS again and finally decided they are countering to {$27000.00} stating our value dispute was denied in XXXX. How was it denied when it was already approved? They did a new DRIVE BY valuation - so they can not see the damages of the home. I have requested that the file be sent back to the investor for final decision - we don't have another 30 days to waste on SPS holding the file due to their inefficient processes.I applied in branch for the Citi XXXX Card. I was informed by the banker that I would be eligible for the " in branch offer '' of XXXX Thank You points and {$350.00} annual fee, as opposed to the online offer of XXXX Thank You points and {$450.00} annual fee. For this reason, I decided to apply. Upon satisfying the sign up requirements, I noticed that my account was only credited XXXX Thank You points and my annual fee ended up being {$450.00} ( similar to the online offer ). Turns out that after a quick google search, that the in-branch offer was only available if you signed up for a checking account as well, however I was not informed this in branch. If I had known that this was the case, I would n't have applied for the card to begin with. I spoke to Citi a few months ago about my complaint, but they were unable to offer a compromise. I am still very upset about this and frankly I feel cheated - I only just found about CFPB and figured that I would document my story here so that others do n't make the same mistake that I did.I receive calls at least once a day from Diversified Consultants , Inc. trying to collect a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy. I consider this intentional harassment, as they know, since the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy, they are absolutely not entitled to collect on it.National Recovery, the individuals allegedly persuing a debt of a XXXX XXXX bill, reported said debt to my credit report with no prior written notice of such claim, no account number associated with said amount due and no chance to pay debt, before they reported alleged debt to my credit. I deserve to have knowledge of said debt and a chance to reconcile such debt, before it impacts my credit score thereof. For such wrongful demeanor and unrelentness false reporting, I request the inquiry be removed. So, I have a chance to dispute such claim ( s ), before the claim has an impact on my CREDIT score, which National Recovery did not give me an option nor a written bill or any validation of said bill even existing prior to the reporting of alleged amount owed to the credit bureaus. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX ( Business Owner/Entrepreneur )Because I filed bankruptcy and included the derogatory items are already in with the bankruptcy they are shown twice in different areas and should be removedAfter reviewing my credit report I saw that I owe Renton Collections for a dental bill that had went into collections. The amount stated is {$280.00}. I called Friday XXXX XXXX asking if they would do a settlement on what I owe. I was told no that I owe {$280.00} and I could either pay that full amount or make two payments of {$140.00}. I said okay I will talk with my husband and see what I can pay and call back. Three business days later I called back to go ahead and just pay the full amount of {$280.00}. I was then told by the guy, XXXX XXXX, that I owe {$420.00}. To my surprise, I said what?, I just called friday and was told that I owe {$280.00} and that I can pay it in full or make two payments of {$140.00} and that they do n't do settlements. I said yes I got that but why did it go from {$280.00} to {$420.00} in three days? He says interest. I then said okay I need to figure something out then. I called back an hour later and asked to speak to a supervisor. Her name was XXXX XXXX, I explained to her my XXXX conversations with the previous agents and she then tells me I owe {$480.00}. I 'm trying to ask about how it went from {$280.00} to {$420.00} and then to {$480.00} all in three business days and she says I must have my numbers wrong and kept bringing up the fact they do n't do settlements. I kept stating, I know that, I want to know why the balance has changed so much. She did not want to answer my direct question why the difference. I got so frustrated I just hung up. It 's upsetting that they treat customers who are trying to pay off a debt now that they 're able to.i have apply for credit card at Brclysbank DE but i was turn down in the report i send you with the attachment on page XXXX at the top brclybank DE is on my report as a creditor i did not get any credit card i have call the company and they say something about deletion letterHello I try and keep track of the items that are on my credit especially my inquiries but yesterday I noticed that I have some inquiries that do not belong to me. I have n't lost any of my information I do n't think and I do n't believe someone has stolen my identity. Please send me information regarding these inquiries or have them removed as soon as possible because it is truly hurting my credit and I do n't have these accounts. TRANSUNION : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXXThe bank keeps charging me fees of {$30.00} a month despite me continually telling them that I want a basic and not a premium checking account. This has been going on for two years.In XX/XX/XXXX, I retrieved my credit report and noted that Accelerated Receivables MG ( reflected as XXXX XXXX on credit reports ) had inserted 4 derogatory accounts on my credit report. This company never sent any correspondence to me that would have informed me of any alleged debt they were attempting to collect. Further, by not receiving any correspondence from them, did not allow me to dispute the validity of their claim. to that end, I submitted a dispute to XXXX XXXX ( although the company was truly Accelerated Receivables ), the address reflected was to Accelerated Receivables. This too is a violation. If they are attempting to collect on a debt, then their name should have been listed and not the alleged original creditor. Accelerated Receivables never responded. So I then sent a copy of the certified letter with return receipt to XXXX to verify that the company did not respond to my dispute letter and the entries should be deleted. The entries were deleted from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I again retrieved a copy of my report an found that Accelerated Receivables had reported these same 4 derogatory accounts, that do not belong to me, on my XXXX   report. I disputed with XXXX but to no avail. XXXX responded well after 30 days only to state the accounts were verified. I submitted a response to their findings by inquiring as to how they were able to get a response from Accelerated and my efforts were not successful as the company just blatantly disregarded my dispute. I then escalated this dispute to the CFPB against XXXX and at XXXX ( as it appeared on my credit report ). It took XXXX over 60 days to respond to the CFPB only to state that they would send a letter with the results from the investigation to me. Again, I received the same letter whereby XXXX stated the accounts were mine. I then sent Accelerated Receivables another letter ( second attempt ) dated XX/XX/XXXX whereby I once again requested that they provide validation of these entries belonging to me. This letter was sent certified with a return receipt and to date, I have not received any correspondence from this company. Additionally, I requested that they provide a copy of the financial responsibility page for the accounts they are alleging I owe. Again, to no avail. This company is outright violating and continuing to violate my rights by reporting these inaccurate entries. These account entries DO NOT BELONG TO ME AND SHOULD BE DELETED FROM MY REPORT IMMEDIATELY! BOTH XXXX & ACCELERATED RECEIVABLES ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW!!!XXXX XXXX of XXXX, FL XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2017 auto loan. Did not give permission for this inquiry. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2017 Did not authorize this inquiry XXXX  Card XXXX XX/XX/2017 Did not authorize this inquiry I have put a freeze on my credit reports with all 3 credit agencies because companies are doing credit checks without my permission via the internet. i am trying to improve my credit to get a house and this is hurting my credit scoresOn XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX MST, I contacted Ally Bank, to change the due date of my car payment to XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to a rep for 17 mins 18 sec. I explained why I needed my due date changed. The rep told me that if I paid {$20.00} by the XX/XX/XXXX that my car payment would not be due until XX/XX/XXXX and I could then set the auto pay for the XXXX of every month to start XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the rep, what about XX/XX/XXXX payment and she stated that my XX/XX/XXXX payment would not be due until XX/XX/XXXX.. I made the payment and it cleared my account XX/XX/XXXX. I tried to go into the system to set my auto payment and the system would not allow it. I called onXX/XX/XXXXat XXXX XXXX. The call lasted for 60 mins and 19 sec. I informed Ally that the system would not allow me to set up auto pay. I was informed that I still owed XX/XX/XXXX payment. I explained what I was told and they stated that I still knewXX/XX/XXXX payment was due. I told them that I was not aware, because the rep told me it was n't due until XX/XX/XXXX. I was transferred to a manager who told me the same thing and still tried to collect the payment. I told that my payment due date would not be extended until I made the payment for XX/XX/XXXX. I told them it was not fair and I no longer had the money because I took the advice of their rep. I told both the rep and the manager that I was going to file my complaint and I was transferred to a third person who said they needed to investigate my claim by listening to the recording and if they found out I was telling the truth, she would help me with my options. She asked that I give her til Tuesday the XXXX before contacting CFPB. It is now Friday the XXXX. I tried to contact Ally on Tuesday the XXXX by phone at XXXX XXXX and by their online email Thursday the XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I still have not gotten any help and the still have not updated my car payment due date and my car payment is late and I would imagine collected late fees. It is not fair to me that I get penalized, when I was directed by their rep. Who either have the wrong info or was not clear when I asked her the questions about my payments.After the massive Equifax data breach was announced in XXXX 2017, my family checked to see if our identities were compromised. My wife, my XXXX old daughter, and I were designated as " potentially compromised. '' My wife and I could sign up for their identity theft monitoring, but their online system would not allow a minor to sign up. When I called their special Security Breach 2017 hotline, the representative just kept repeating that Equifax " generally does n't '' have  information on minors. She could not explain why my daughter 's SSN would be in their system. She said that I would need to call Equifax directly, but she did not even have the number to call. Trying to contact Equifax directly has been futile. They have deliberately obfuscated any direct way of contacting them. So far, I can not even determine a simple question -- does the SSN associated with my baby have any credit history or other association with Equifax? According to one rep, the answer should be " no, '' but she can not confirm it. So far, the only way I think I may get any answers is sending copies of important, sensitive documents ( my and my daughter 's SS cards, birth certificates, etc ) directly to Equifax. Since they could not protect the data of 143 million people, I really do n't want to add my daughter 's information to their company if it does not already exist. These credit reporting companies take our personal information and sell it as a commodity. They will give MY information to some random credit card company who wants to send me an offer, but I have to jump through hoops just to find out if my daughter 's identity is even actually compromised. They are XXXX.I booked a ticket for XXXX XXXX. XXXX changed my times, which rendered the flight unusable, so I booked a new flight at an earlier time with a different airline ( XXXX ). All of these were with the American Express Platinum card. I was n't able to gain any headway with XXXX about this change to the flight schedule, so I contacted Amex. They issued a charge back to my account crediting me. I just found out that Amex reversed the charge back on me.Back in XX/XX/XXXX I got a call from a XXXX XXXX Credit card company saying that I was past due on my credit card. I have never applied for this card, so I asked when it was open and how much was owed ant the address on this card. I was told that it was open XX/XX/XXXX, there was a balance of {$140.00} on the card. I was told that it was sent to an apartment. She would not give me the address. I told her that I DO NOT live in an apartment I have lived in the house or the past 16 years. She told me that it was only the start up fee and late fees that were on the card. I have told her that it needs to be closed, I did not get it or apply for it. She said it would be closed and I would receive a letter. It can take up to 90 days for it to be cleared off my credit report. I have received a letter stating that the account is closed. Still to this day, it is on my credit report, causing major issues. It shows it as currently open, That I am LATE on the payment with a negative pay status. This needs to come off my credit report, it is now XX/XX/XXXX, and it is still on there.On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I mailed Registered Mail ( # XXXX ) to Nationstar Mortgage and it was received and sign for on XXXX XXXX, by XXXX XXXX XXXX. A STATE CERTIFIED BOND ASSIGNMENT was enclosed for the amount {$230000.00} to payoff the loan, with the payoff statement. Nationstar Mortgage acknowledged that payment was received and the account was never credited and closed. Nationstar Mortgage have not sent my Bond Payment back to me, the account should have been adjusted to SATISFACTION IN FULL., to this day, it is not. I would like to have my money back or adjust the account and closed it. UCC XXXX, states if a tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, the debt is discharged. Please investigate, there is some fraud taking place.I opened an account with BBVA and transferred a balance. I noticed my first payment had not been withdrawn from my account, called the company and was informed that I had mailed the payment to the wrong address. I got the correct address and remitted payment. The payment was made before a late fee should have been incurred, but I was charged one anyway. The phone support said there was nothing they could do. The company then started started charging me a {$1.00} monthly fee as I had had a late charge. I phoned a local branch and spoke with a helpful person who got the late fee refunded, and said the {$4.00} in minimum fees which had been charged to my account would be returned. I received my statement today. The late fee was refunded, but the {$4.00} dollars in minimum fees were not, and an additional {$1.00} fee was charged to my account. I am in the zero interest period on my account. My statement indicates {$0.00} balance subject to interest rate. I should not be incurring any fees or interest. In addition, the balance transfer fee is listed on the account as a cash advance. I have made no cash advances or purchases on this account. I am concerned about their business practices.I am filing this complaint because ChexSystems has demonstrated some seriously broken " investigative '' processes of consumer initiated disputes. ChexSystems does not follow a well articulated investigative process, but instead launch " re-investigations '' on their own accord without the consumers request, that yield differing results than prior investigations. They refuse to provide information to consumers that substantiate the outcome of their investigations. Sadly, Chex also adds inaccurate information to consumer files at the whim of their broken administrative processes. ChexSystems absolves themselves of any responsibility for the accuracy of information contained in their systems, but instead casts responsibility to their customers, and forces the consumer to address problems directly with ChexSystems customers, unless providing a police report. Unfortunately some police agencies do n't issue " police reports '' when a crime has not been clearly consummated. In some cases a consumer may want to guard against the release of accurate consumer information to prevent perpetuating additional fraud. Having gone through investigations with XXXX other Credit Reporting Agencies over the same set of fraudulent inquiries without a " police report '', ALL of the interactions with other Credit Reporting Agencies were consumer friendly, were well defined, were conducted in a professional manner without putting personal information at risk, did not require " re-investigations '', and resulted in the complete removal of all fraudulent and inaccurate information in my consumer file at their firms. Details of the interactions with ChexSystems are contained in the attached file. ChexSystems does not provide direct contact information to a consumer to consult directly with a ChexSystems employee. Every communication sent from ChexSystems is sent to the consumer anonymously.Capital One Bank has posted negative remarks of payment lateness on my credit report without providing me with any options to resolve this matter to the best of my interest.I took out a mortgage with HSBC to buy my home XX/XX/XXXX.all payments I make electronically from my bank account.it always shows the date withdrawn, the date received and a confirmation number.back around XX/XX/XXXX HSBC wrote me and stated I should start sending my mortgage payments to XXXX XXXX.I started paying XXXX XXXX electronically from my bank account.XXXX has been sporadically reporting me late to the credit bureau even though they receive these payments on time.

HSBC owns my mortgage.They make me send my payments to XXXX mortgage and then they report me late to the credit bureaus using the name Mortgage service center.Ditech performed an inaccurate Escrow analysis on my home and has increased my mortgage amount over the past two year s.      XXXX   County refunded Ditech {$2100.00} that was the amount of the over payment and the company has still not d isbursed my funds.     They also are not processing my mortgage payments because my payment amount is not the same as their overestimated mortgage amount that they have just increased on my end.I recently moved from XXXX  to XXXX for work and listed my house for sale. I owe about $ 250K to Chase. It seems the house is worth less and I applied for assistance in XX/XX/XXXX. In the interim we received a qualified offer at $ XXXX. After much aggravation, Chase declined this short sale because my loan is not delinquent. I am no longer able to pay the mortgage and my new rent, and Chase seems more willing to drive me into foreclosure than accept this offer.I received a call from XXXX stating they need to confirm I would be home to serve me papers from another agency. I asked for that agencys information and they gave me a number to call, XXXX. My call was answered by XXXX who had the last four of my social my maiden name only and simply told me they were going to garnish my wages for the amount of XXXX which the original balance was XXXX the remaining is their legal fees. I asked for further information and was given an account number of XXXX which i called Bank of America about, and did the same 4 years ago when a collector tried the same thing, and again they have no records of me having a negative debt with them. I have an account with them currently. I asked her the date on the account and its from XX/XX/2006, that is when it was closed. When I asked for more information she got hostile after I told her that it wasn't a legitimate account, and just said I will be served and have to go to court and hung up on me. I tried to call back and could not get anyone to answer after the phone kept ringing for 10 minutes. I used my XXXX XXXX account to call from a different number and within 30 seconds XXXX answered and I asked the company name which was given to me as XXXX and said it wasn't an Acronym. I asked for an address and they hung up.I contacted Syncrony Financial over the XXXX to close a Care Credit account. I spoke with a customer service rep and confirmed several times that the care credit account was paid in full and would be closed. It turns out Syncrony did not close my Care Credit account and recently sent me a new plastic card. I just called and the customer service rep told me an account related to a mattress purchase was closed. The last activity on this mattress account had occurred in 2009 and should have been closed at that time following a phone call I had made to close the account. It seems Syncrony is not closing accounts as requested.I was listed on a lawsuit filed by Kramer and Frank P.C. which I am not a party to. This was on my wife.

They refunded my kohls card {$46.00} and claim I have a balance of over {$1000.00} which is impossible. I attempted to chat online and wasted 15 minutes or more. I emailed the email on the packing slips and it is invalid. I have sent messages on the website and of course am told to call. I hate talking on the phone and why would I waste more of my time when I asked for a fax or correct email to send attachments of the shipping label and packing slips/emails with all the returned items circled and highlighted that I mailed with the items? Talking on the phone isn't going to let me show proof. I mailed copies of all this last week to corporate and have not gotten a response. They refuse to give me my refund and I have more items to send back and of course I can't since I know they will mess that up too. I have filed a complaint with the BBB and it is unresolved.

Today when I called to ask about the cancelled payment, I was told that my money would be returned in 7 to 14 days. After 14 days, I checked and discovered that my refund has not been processed.

I attached a certified disposition from XXXX County, GA courthouse. 3.

The check included was in the amount of {$190.00} for the payment of that month. XXXX converted the check to a digital check and cashed it, but the late notice was not removed from my credit report.I have been advised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that they sent my complaint to you. Case # XXXX / Bank of America. I 'm checking to make sure you received it, because there is more to add to it. Thank you, XXXX XXXXI am a victim of identity theft. I have been trying to contact XXXX XXXX for a very long time now. Their representatives were being very rude and threatening. I tried to contact them to send them my FTC Identity Theft Affidavit, my police report information, as well as documentation proofing I have been living in XXXX for the last 10 years and not an address in XXXX. They denied me the opportunity and kept giving me the runaround. I don't understand why XXXX XXXX is refusing to acknowledge my Identity Theft problem. and trying to sue me and collect on a debt that is not mine. I am submitting this complaint due to the lack of response, communication, and investigation into my original dispute for a debt that does belong to me. This unfair practices by a debt collection company with no concern for the integrity of a customer.Several years ago I purchased a car from XXXX XXXX. At the time of picking up the car I had auto insurance with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Michigan and I told the dealer to contact my insurance agent and transfer my XXXX insurance policy to my new car. The salesman only was interested in delivering the car, and without my permission contacted an agent who purchased an insurance policy with XXXX XXXX. The policy never went into effect, I never bought insurance from them as I had valid insurance with AAA. The fact that XXXX XXXX is alleging I owe them {$1100.00} is part of a criminal fraud between their agent and the dealership salesman. XXXX, XXXX a credit collection agency for XXXX XXXX is adversely reporting a collection account.XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX Accounts were opened in my name using my identifying information. I notified company fraud department to dispute accounts and was told that accounts were mine. I requested validations for the accounts and still have not received validation. The accounts are still being reported negatively on my credit reports.I had a XXXX salesman named XXXX come to my home in 2012. We settled on {$1200.00} for the XXXX {$62.00} a month, I planed to pay {$120.00} to pay it off faster. I revived a bill two days later for {$4100.00} XXXX! I was shocked. I called right away. Said I wanted to contact my salesman. They said he no longer worked there. I said I wanted to cancel, they said no. I couldn't because he was no longer employed and it had to be through him. I said I cancel and they needed to pick it up. They refused. I did not have a contract at all. The sale man had said he would be back to get my trade in and final contract. He never returned. I still have my old vacuum shown on their " contract '' as my trade in. I had asked several times to see a contract since I didn't have one. They sent one that had a list price of {$2400.00}, not {$1200.00} as decided. The salesman had left several packs of new contracts at my home. Which I still have. I signed the cancel from one of those contractfs and faxed to them with the number they had on their answering machine. Trying to find that old fax machine to see if I can get proof of transmison. I called them at day 19 informing them that per their own contract if they did not pick up the vacuum up I can retain or dispose without further obligation because I canceled. This is wrong. Now I have been served for this debt. I will gladly pay the {$1200.00} or give the unused vacuum back. Pieces still in plastic with a never used bag. But I should not have to give it back, they had 20 days to get it per their own " contract ". I did track down the salesman, but he says he can not remember any specifics to my sale. This is not a proper way to conduct business.My Barclaycard was lost and/or stolen. I requested a new card via voice and via Barclaycard 's online portal. Despite multiple requests, Barclaycard refuses to send a new card.I have come to realize Chase bank has been rearranging the order of my transactions to maximize fees and it has snowballed out of control. I understand I have agreed to an over draft type of protection that I am charged a fee of {$34.00} when used. However, I did not agree to allow Chase to rearrange the order of my transactions to maximize fees. When I attempt to make a purchase or pay a bill using my bank card and there are not enough funds in my account my transaction is declined. I first realized something was amiss XXXX. I could not figure out why I had so many overdraft fees for transactions that I knew I had funds to cover and were approved. I went to the branch to sit down and go over each item with their representative. Neither he, his manager nor I could figure out how this happened but they were kind ( I think due to my being unemployed ) and credited me XXXX or XXXX of the many fees. When looking at the transactions as they were listed on my account it all made sense. However, when trying to get to the root of the problem I struggled - I knew I had adequate funds when I proceeded with the transactions and how could the transaction be approved if I was in the negative? Now that I closely monitor my account I have learned in the last few weeks that Chase rearranges the order transactions are posted and I firmly believe it is to maximize fees which I consider to be a predatory banking practice. They post larger dollar amount transactions first that snowball into {$34.00} fees for {$9.00} or {$10.00} transactions that would not be approved if funds were not available. In one instance One week I paid bills, grocery shopped and withdrew {$20.00} from my account. I did all this early in the week. All transactions were approved by the bank and all reflected on my account ( transactions are reflected same day ). A few days later I paid a bill that I knew I would utilize OD protection. Chase rearranged the transactions posting the higher bill payment first causing a {$34.00} fee, then {$100.00} transaction causing another {$34.00} fee then the {$9.00} and {$20.00} transactions charging XXXX more fees. My account had funds to cover all transactions when they occurred ( except the bill payment that occurred days after the other transactions ) and they were originally showing in the chronological order the transactions happened with a correct balance. I called the bank to review this with them detailing when transactions actually happened and how it originally showed correct chronological order and how the order changed after the bill payment but unfortunately I am dissatisfied with the outcome. They see no wrong doing on their part and because I already had XXXX courtesy credits of fees ( maximum allowed within a 12 month time frame ) they wo n't consider refunding more. I now do not consider the refunds I received in XXXX as a courtesy nor do I consider my current request as a courtesy because of their deliberate practice being a means to maximize fees. I have been charged approximately XXXX {$34.00} fees in the last month or so of which only XXXX are valid. This is more than my unemployment check. In addition, they have not covered all checks despite my having over draft protection. They returned a check but still charged me {$34.00} for returned check fee.I am a victim of identity theft.

There is no one they will allow me to talk to in the Financial Management Department & they refuse to send me to someone in that department or email them on my behalf. I just want to be able to pay my bill online and automatically. What other Loan Services refuses to take payments FOREVER automatically becuase a  client had a issue with ACH payments once YEARS ago?I have phoned FMS several times left many messages XXXX XXXX, Vice President of Compliance.

It was then sent to a debt collector because it was not paid on time. I was working on a settlement with XXXX XXXX at the time. It finally got settled and closed out, however, it is still on my credit score and making it lower. I need it removed from my credit score as soon as possible because I am trying to get a loan for a new car.

Nothing in writing from Stellar. Finally received copy of final bill from XXXX after making 3 requests.

I told XXXX XXXX collection agencies are required by law to notify a consumer in writing giving them 30 days to respond by dispute or paying the balance. If a consumer does n't respond, they can proceed with collection procedures up to and including adding info to your credit report. Stellar did n't do anything but add my unpaid balance to my credit file and my score dropped XXXX points as a result. All XXXX XXXX said was, " I 'm sorry this happened to you I can tell you are someone who pays her bills. '' Not to mention this will stay on my credit for 3 to 7 years. Also, XXXX XXXX said I will have to call them back in 30 days to request a payoff letter as they will not send out a confirmation of payment automatically. Wanted my permission to call me on the phone just in case they needed to tell me something - I asked what they would need to talk to me about - I agreed to allow them to contact me by email first preference or by US mail and she argued once I refused to allow them to call me she then asked for my email. I declared my dissatisfaction of their bad business practices and told XXXX XXXX I would be filing a complaint with the FTC. Of the XXXX complaints I doubt mine will be addressed, however, I formally request immediate confirmation of payment made to Stellar Recovery and the collection be taken completely off my credit report.I have a XXXX degree from XXXX ( XXXX, OH ) and XXXX from the XXXX. During my education period, XXXX managed my student loans and then my loans were acquired by Navient Solutions , Inc . Overtime, my loan has balooned to over {$140000.00}. Accordingly, Navient graciously placed my loans in forebearance ( time & time again ) while I continued to seek alternate means to repay my student debt. Research after research on various student loan plans, I contacted Navient to inquire about the Income Base program. Again, they graciously enrolled me into the Income Based program, which resulted in payments of aproximately {$1300.00}, which again, I could not afford to pay. The {$1300.00} payment was based on both mine and my husband 's income. I immediately notified Navient to inform them that my husband too had student loans with Navient and XXXX. Thus, my payment was reduced to {$900.00}. I am currently XXXX years old soon to turn XXXX in XXXX 2017. My student debt has placed a burden on my marriage and my health. I can not retire, tried working a parttime job for two years at a retail store because of my student loan debt. I have worked for the XXXX for 17-years and currently I 'm employed in XXXX over the past 9-years. Again, after future research on my part, I have learned about the Student Loan Forgiveness program and have successfully applied. I recently received notice by Navient that the U.S. Department of Education will soon transfer the customer service of my federal student loan account to XXXX. I 'm still in the unsure if I 'll be able to meet the repayment plan, but hopefully I 'm on the right track to repay the enormous student debt.

For some unknown reason, those collection notices are still on my credit report and are causing a lot of XXXX moments the medical problems which I am currently suffering.Back in 2010, when I was busy with school, work, and volunteer activities, I was talked into signing up for a second credit card with Chase Bank, and told that this was a smart move to help build credit. I was told that this card came with overdraft protection to protect overdrafts from my checking account with the same institution. Meanwhile, I had my first credit card setup to pay the balance in full. In short, money was transferred from checking to clear the balance on the first card, and this pulled credit from the other card, which came with biannual fees and raising my interest rate from 19 % to 26 %. When I tried, numerous times over the years, to address this with Chase they ignored me, or diverted the issue. Interest rates are a function of risk. What is the risk to Chase when XXXX card is being paid off with their money? If a person did this, it would be check-kiting.I have credit monitoring and noticed a " collection '' noted with TransUnion.

I filed my complaint on the following basis. 1. Did XXXX sent me a letter in regards to Treasury Offset ( TOP ) 2. Transworld never advised per letter that they will collect on debt 3. Transworld added further fees to benefit themselves at my expense. 4. Any attempt to contact XXXX to re solve this matter was not accomplished. XXXX  refused to assist on resolving my concerns with the excuse by customer service that I was fully aware of a debt. 5. Attempt to communicate with Transworld was with excuses to collect and I spoke to a supervisor that refuse to assist in resolving the matter any further. I was treated unfairly and with disrespect. Soon after I filed my complaint with the FTC consumer complaint ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the following occurred. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, provided me copies of Transworld debt collection ( itemized ) they continue by saying of Federal laws protecting my rights but my rights were not protected why I tried to resolve this matter before my complaints. Secondly, all documents received by CFPB and attached to me on the resolution could not be read. Why CFPB did not notice this matter. XXXX, then proceeded to send me documents of the same attachment. XXXX  sent statements and a letter in small font ( required magnifying glass to read ) and if I had concerns of my right to communicate this with XXXX, again prior to my complaint, I called XXXX trying to resolve this matter and they continue to say you know you had a debt! Why call if they will not listen to me and try to get this matter without a third party collection. The problem, I read per XXXX  letter provided by Transworld XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  : if you do not pay your debt or take other actions described below within 60 days from the date of this Letter.

Both XXXX and Transworld has conspired to insure my Federal Tax Refund is taken away regardless of the agreement set forth in XXXX  letters. My Federal Tax refund dated for XX/XX/XXXX of {$540.00} was taken away from me. I am aware of the TOP law since I work for an agency that handles this type of collection. We advise of the 60 day rule and collection will not be prior to the 60 days.On   XXXX     i submitted a complaint with CFPB regardingg my  Kohls  store card. Complaint #  XXXX  with the CFPB.

Their website states they 're here to help but has chosen to ignore my request for a deferment and I have been subjected to numerous phone calls and e-mails from them. If I knew that updating my information with them would have this negative consequence I would of never given them my new information. I am having financial difficulties and requested a deferment until XX/XX/XXXX of this year but they have ignored the request and instead I am the recipient of near constant phone calls and e-mails.

After that, the calls kept coming anyway.My ex-boyfriend called XXXX XXXX to schedule appointments for my children whom I am the primary custodial parent. He never took the children to the appointments because they live with me. I did not know the appointments were scheduled and as a result i was charged no show fees of {$50.00} each. I never authorized XXXX XXXX to see my children or make appointments without my consent. Additionally I was charged {$50.00} I believe for medical records that were never faxed to the other medical provider nor do I wish to have the medical records sent again.

My attorney and I have contacted the companies at least 10 times with no response. The bills should NEVER have been placed on my credit reports and should be removed ASAP from all three credit bureaus.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX is reporting a account from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they keep reaging it and I never had that account opened with XXXX and I am confused on why I am being held responsible for the account. If all of the creditor 's are reporting to the same bureaus, why is the information inaccurate and their reporting different information and it is affecting my credit file and score and I am being held accountable for fraud committed against me. I want proof and I want these negative and inaccurate accounts to be removed because I haven't seen proof of me opening them and they are negatively affecting me and that is against the law.

They told me i am not eligible for that promotion. But i already got {$150.00} as bonus. Its just missing {$50.00}. But they they told me you can only get that if you apply online i cleared them i saw that online on your website and applied and you approved my application. And I took the screenshot of the offer. when i applied so i have that screenshot. I followed all their terms to get that bonus but they are just trying to scam me out {$50.00}.

Said company responded to my request by sending me a contract that list my name a customer ( co-borrower? ) but in fact does not have my signature on any of the spaces provided for customer signature, in fact the only person whose signature is recorded on the contract ( on two separate signature lines ) is XXXX XXXX  ( customer ) and the sales person ( XXXX XXXX. ) I feel this is not verification that I entered into a contract neither with XXXX  or Perfection Collection and because this is unverified by law they are required to remove this information from my credit report they have yet to do that, in fact they have added another collection to my reports (XX/XX/XXXX ) from the same company ( XXXX  ) for a larger amount.Inaccurate accounts are reporting on my credit file : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXIn a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the bank ( falsely ) claims that the entire forgiven amount {$150000.00} was principal. That amount as principal is not possible -- based on the declared principal at the time of my original purchase and the new principal due per the work out plan. The bank, under the direction of the Federal Bankruptcy court for mediation, finally offered me a workout plan based on the bank 's determination of the current value of my home. To my knowledge, there was NO independent appraisal. That mediated agreement was signed XXXX XXXX XXXX. The details for that FUTURE workout plan included the bank 's claim that I owed {$290000.00}. I do not know how they made up this number. There was never a time when I owed such an amount as principal. The original note I signed in XXXX was for a principal amount of {$180000.00}. The new principal amount from the XXXX agreement is {$120000.00} ( interest bearing ) + {$13000.00} ( non-interest bearing ). That is a difference of {$49000.00} in principal. Where the {$150000.00} claimed as PRINCIPAL by the bank came from is a complete mystery. It seems the bank can make up whatever numbers they like and make whatever claims they wish and too bad for the consumer. First, I 'm told by the bank contact provided that I will have an answer by XXXX XXXX. -- to the simple question I asked in XXXX. Then, I receive a notice that it will be XXXX XXXX. Today, I received a notice today that the bank will contact me sometime within 60 days. It took the bank TWO months to send a notice that they will respond sometime in the next TWO Months? What then? Another notice that the bank will take another 6 months to send another notice? This is not reasonable. The bank has the information -- they had it when the provided the work-out plan -- in XXXX XXXX and they had it when they sent the confirming paperwork in XXXX of XXXX and they had it when they sent the final paperwork in XXXX of XXXX. The bank is refusing to disclose essential financial information to me - the consumer. What purpose does it serve to not provide me with the proper, lawful disclosures of financial information? I did NOT ask to renegotiate or change anything -- I simply requested the specific numbers for principal, interest, insurance, and taxes.I was a victim of Hurricane Irma in XX/XX/XXXX. My mortgage was put into forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX. I had damage to my home and lost employment over the storm. Once my mortgage was taken out of forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX, I was reported late to the credit bureaus. I was also reported late during forbearance and was sent to dept collection agency during forbearance. I was told that I had to pay back all the past due in one lump sum or risk foreclosure on my home. I informed my mortgage servicer that I could not pay that and requested a loan modification. It took from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to get my loan mod complete, all in between I was reported late for 7 months on my credit reports. XXXX XXXX owns my mortgage and I opened up a claim with them. After some time, I was told by XXXX XXXX that the way this mortgage serve handled my account was incorrect. XXXX XXXX   contacted my mortgage servicer and informed them that per XXXX XXXX guideline, I should not of been reported late during any of this and that the negative reporting was to be removed from my credit. This is not the case. I have filed disputes directly with the credit bureaus, and my mortgage services keeps sending over false/incorrect information when I dispute it. My family has suffered financial hardship over this, my credit is now trashed. I also suspect that this servicer has falsified their service records as now my account seems to show different information according to the customer service reps that service the account when I contact them. I can prove that incorrect information was sent over to the credit agencies, and I can also prove that this servicer has broken RESPA and XXXX XXXX  guidelines. I am also aware of the on going lawsuit against this servicer which pertains to the unlawful practices ( RESPA/ Guideline Violations ) filed by former employees that were fired from the servicer around XX/XX/XXXX for whistle blowing. I find it very strange that this was around the time, XX/XX/XXXX when I starting having problems with them. I can prove that they have not followed guidelines with all the docs that I have.

The only options they gave me is either sale the home or I will be going into foreclosure,Being on XX/XX/XXXX I started to receive calls for the company referenced in this complaint.. the first call I requested over the phone that they send me validation of the debt that they alleged that I owed. The person on the other end of the line refused to give me their name and began threatening to file criminal charges on me and take everything that I owned. I again asked for them to send me validation of the debt that they alleged I owned the person yells at me and said since I refused to pay they were going to send a warrant to my home county and they would be there to arrest me. I hung up following the threats and yelling.. the next day I received a call from this same company. I asked again for them to send me validation of this debt that they alleged I owed.. these calls went on for almost to weeks. When I received a notification that 2 debts had been placed on my credit report. Without validation without written notice of this debt! According to the Fair debt collection practice act I am to receive in writing the notice of this debt before it is placed on my credit file. Also according to the Fair debt collection practice act and Ohio consumer sale practice act they are not allowed to falsely represent themselves as a law office or falsely accuse me of a crime. This debt has not been validated and has become detrimental to my credit score and has prevented me from obtaining financing! I again want the account removed! Until the company can provide me with the information that I have asked for! I still know nothing about this alleged debt! The amount where it came from nothing.. just threats to go to jail. I want this actions to stop!Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a representative from AES. We discussed options for natural disaster forebearance and later loan repayment options. I told her that someone called me yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, and said I needed to use their services to consolidate my loan and get loan forgiveness if I made 3 payments. I started the process and went through the security questions. After which, I did not complete the call because my phone battery died. When he called back, it died again so he texted me repeatedly. I finally called him and there was no answer. He called me repeatedly again and when i did n't answer, started sending me threatening and inappropriate and unprofessional text messages which I have documented and sent me a screenshot where he had disabled my FSA ID so that I can not access my account. He continued sending me inappropriate texts and I did not respond any further.I wrote to the bureaus about two ( 2 ) XXXX XXXX account that I have that is closed and have a paid status on my credit report. I wrote them asking for the removal of the late payment on my account which I am still seeing and causing a negative impact on my credit.

When I finally was able to connect I asked who & where I was talking to the person would not give me their name and said they were from XXXX ( would not give specific country ) ; additional they had difficulty articulating in the English language. I asked multiple times to be connected to the UNITED STATES - each request was denied. I do not trust giving my information to someone overseas and I heavily object they have my information as well as that of other students. Navient needs to provide, without delay, a phone number that connects the student borrower to an actual person in the United States. This is highly unacceptable and there should be legislation preventing this from happening. I DO NOT AUTHORIZE THE " CONSUMERS FINANCE PROTECTIO BUREAU '' to release my email to Navient whatsoever.I purchased a vehicle from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I did have some issues with repairs during that time the company did fix the issues, ( some and others we had to deal with ourselves ) ; however I have been having issues with XXXX XXXX reporting my loan information correctly. The first time I contacted MM was in XX/XX/XXXX and requested, for XXXX to correct the loan and monthly payment amount, they corrected the loan amount and still had the incorrect monthly payment. I was checking my credit back in XX/XX/XXXX, still was not fixed I waited and check again in XX/XX/XXXX and notice again the information was wrong with XXXX XXXX, so I contacted the business and Experian to report incorrect information on my credit with XXXX XXXX, once again the loan and the monthly payment amount was incorrect. I spoke with XXXX and she told me XXXX   have changed their reporting company due to issues, so I asked her why I have to keep dealing with this issue, she stated I wasn't the only one dealing with the issue, as if I was supposed to feel better. Then she proceed to tell me I need to contact the Credit Agency and dispute, well I had already filed the dispute twice and this would be the 3rd time  disputing. When I called Experian they told me to contact the Business, so I contacted XXXX again she was very rude, when I was telling her this information about my credit and that their company is reporting fraudulent information. Since XX/XX/XXXX Experian have tried to contact XXXX  for a month to get the correct information. Now I notice with All Reporting Agencies, XXXX XXXX loan has been closed on my crediting report, of course I am still paying and still trying to find out what I need to do to get this information corrected on my credit report and now working on getting XXXX  to report my car loan. The loan amount is currently {$13000.00} and the monthly payments is XXXX, however I pay XXXX - biweekly, never been lately or missed or payment. So now inaccurate information remains after the complainant disputes it, and now they are not reporting the information to any Credit Agency. The owner did reach out but he was asking me to send him information to show my loan amount and my credit report to show the loan is closed. If the finance department is reporting my loan information to their reporting company and the report company notifying the Credit Agency, why do I have to do their leg work? If I was late or stop paying they would rush to report. I also wanted to know if XXXX  ( private financing ) have to report the interest on my loan to the Credit Agencies, or should they only report the loan amount. Personally I feel if I am paying Loan + Interest, every thing should be reported. Thank you for your time and assistance with this matter.Loan Number XXXX Property Address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, WV XXXX NationStar : XXXX Starting XX/XX/XXXX, I established up a bimonthly payment process to maximize my payments against the interest for the year for a secondary property. The XX/XX/XXXX payment was not processed correctly because, according to Nationstar Mortgage LLC a subservicer for XXXX, their systems aren't able to process bimonthly payments. I have a mortgage with XXXX XXXX for a primary residence and not having an issue with them. This is what happened with Nationstar : My initial payment transmitted on XX/XX/XXXX electronically. Because it was a half payment, Nationstar applied it to XX/XX/XXXX as a principal payment. Because Nationstar processed it as a XX/XX/XXXX payment, I started receiving phone calls from Nationstar, even though the grace period through the XXXX of the month, hadn't passed, advising me that I was delinquent. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that I was delinquent for the month of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the second part of my payment was processed for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, Nationstar generated a letter stating that I was assessed a {$15.00} late fee on my account, my account was delinquent and placed the 2nd part of my payment in an unapplied accounts fund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Nationstar, they advised me that their systems can't accommodate bimonthly payments. They had to move the 1st part of the XXXX payment that they applied to XX/XX/XXXX to the XX/XX/XXXX payment and removed the {$15.00} late fee. They advised that I should pay more each month to accomplish what I am attempting to accomplish to save on interest since their systems can't accommodate. Because Nationstar can't accommodate bimonthly payments, they aren't depositing funds into my account when processed to prevent further accrual of interest against the principal on my accounts ; therefore, penalizing the customer for system issues that they can't support. I attempted to escalate to the XXXX Executive Team, but was transferred back to Nationstar Executive Team. I am requesting that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Nationstar Mortgage LLC, XXXX TX be investigated for their payment processing practices. The loan papers do not indicate that bimonthly payments can not be processed and that full payments are expected or funds will be put into an unapplied accounts fund. I can supply copies of correspondence if it helps in the research.XX/XX/XXXX Flooding occurred I contacted XXXX XXXX ( insurance provider ). They told me I could pull out anything wet. I pulled out clothing, towels, ruined items, furniture, etc. They sent an adjuster. At his visit he said that he was approving me for an {$8000.00} building check to get started. And to go ahead and contact my mortgage company, because they would need to endorse it as well. He also told me that I could pull out anything wet. He informed me that I did not have to have a license contractor to do work in the house. I could choose who I wanted or do it myself. I immediately called Chase, told them I flooded, have a check coming and asked what did I need to do. The woman told me to write down a tracking number, sign the check and submit to them so they could endorse it. At this time I didnt know that they kept the money and dealt it out to me.

Saw that online. Had no notification. XX/XX/XXXX Found out forms were not waived by chase. Talked to XXXX XXXX asked why inspection was cancelled. She said ( the second time I have been told this ) that the notes say the inspection was cancelled because they tried to contact me. Thats what Ive been told both times. She said that the reason was probably because I still didnt have a licensed contractor, even though it was noted otherwise. I never had any calls from inspectors or messages even though they said I had at least 6 calls concerning. I asked to speak with a supervisor, got XXXX XXXX, resolution specialist/account supervisor. Needed a license and the request was never approved. She said you can request anything you want, doesnt mean youre going to get it. Thats the point of a request. All said in a matter of fact and condescending tone. I informed her Chase had told me to do the request in the first place and ensured me it was fine for my situation. XX/XX/XXXX 3rd Inspection requested XX/XX/XXXX Letter mailed by chase saying received exception request but cant approve until they have paid in full invoices and valid receipts exceeding {$28000.00} released thus far.

XX/XX/XXXX Talked to XXXX at XXXX. Said I needed a contractors license or things could be made simpler if I switch to self-contractor. I said I had never heard that was possible, and first time I knew it was an option. She said it was possible if I had a current mortgage with them. Though if she switched me over to self-contracting, that I couldnt use the insurance check site and had to pay all out of pocket first then get submitted when totally done. I said I dont feel comfortable switching, I need to speak with my lawyer on what I should do because a ) I need an electronic record of everything and self-contracting relies on faxing and mail b ) how do I can I be ensured the money will come to me at the end? She said she was going to call XXXX to see if instead of a license he could produce proof of insurance / surety bond. I said feel free. She said that would work to release my funds.

She also said the notes said XXXX XXXX had been called but no answer on XX/XX/XXXX.

How can Equifax verify inaccurate information as accurate? By law it is Equifaxs job to ONLY allow accurate and correct information to be entered onto my credit report. How can this account come back as verified? I disputed this account XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I am challenging this account for the third time. I am challenging this account for the following reasons : There should be no past due on a charged off/closed account yet Equifax lists a past due amount of {$1900.00}. How is this accurate? There should be no monthly payment on a charged off/closed account yet Equifax lists a monthly payment of {$1900.00}. How is this accurate? Each bureau lists a different monthly payment. XXXX  $ XXXX/Equifax $ XXXX/XXXX  {$1900.00} How is this accurate? Each bureau lists a different open date. XXXX  XX/XX/XXXXXXXX Equifax XX/XX/XXXX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX How is this accurate? Equifax does not list a date of last activity on this credit report. That is a violation.Called Bank  of America credit card costumer service Nevada location on  XXXX   XXXX ,  2017  to resolve a late fee charge of {$25.00}, same day I immediately pay a certain amount of my existing bill. The lady who answered my call told that i can not get the fee back since it already happens twice. On my end, it just so happen that I forgot to log in on my due date and forgot to pay my bills on time which when i remember 5 days after i paid not only the minimum amount and that 's the reason why i called them right away for that late fee. I call them for their consideration and also ask them for help to set up auto deduction in which they cant do it for me instead they want me to do it myself. Everyone is busy and sometimes might fall on the cr ack. Got very ups et with the lady who answered my call who can not resolve the issue but argues with me. I even asked if I can speak with his supervisor but keep on arguing and did n't escalate the issue to the right person. I ended up the call closing my credit card account with them.Confirmed with company that they are garnishing wages without a court order Confirmed they have received payments for the full amount owed - XX/XX/2018. Calling me after hours of XXXX and before XXXXOverview of Problem -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Despite providing clear and convincing evidence that proves beyond any doubt that I paid a lien in XXXX XXXX, Equifax will not change my credit report to reflect the correct payment date. Details -- -- -- - I paid a XXXX ( XXXX ) state tax lien in full XXXX XXXX. The XXXX failed to report the payment to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for recording until XXXX XXXX, over 2 years late. Because the XXXX records the release date as the date the XXXX transmits the information, the public record reports the release date as XXXX XXXX. After the release was filed in XXXX XXXX, I requested the XXXX record a corrected document stating the proper release date of XXXX XXXX. The XXXX would not record a corrected release, so I requested help from the XXXX commissioner in correcting this error. The XXXX was successful in getting the XXXX to add a notation to the official record that the payment was made in XXXX XXXX, but the XXXX still would not refile the release with the correct date. I submitted a request to Equifax that this be changed on my credit report. The result stated that the item was reporting correctly and thus was not removed. The notation made by the XXXX was evidently not enough proof. In XXXX, I wrote to the new XXXX commissioner. This resulted in the local XXXX providing a signed letter stating that the improper recording date was not my fault, and that I paid the full amount in XXXX XXXX. I again submitted a dispute to Equifax. Equifax responded stating the item was not even reporting on my credit file. I have to assume they did not understand how to cross-reference the XXXX records with the XXXX 's records. I then called Equifax at the number provided and spoke to two phone representatives. Neither provided satisfactory answers to my questions and I requested a supervisor. I was transferred to someone in Equifax 's office of consumer affairs ( name withheld ). This person was professional and courteous, and helpful to a point. The person listened to my concerns, but even with the clear evidence including an original, signed copy of the letter from the XXXX stating the correct payment date, the person would not make the correction. The person agreed to resubmit the dispute to the XXXX with all of the information I had provided. The result of their new investigation was the same. They still claim the item is reporting correctly and will not remove it from my report. To recap, the XXXX may be the reporting agency, but they are NOT the party to which the money was owed. In the mind of the XXXX, they are reporting the item correctly. However, the party to which the money was owed, the XXXX, confirms payment was made in full in XXXX XXXX. The XXXX also acknowledges it did not transmit the payoff information to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) in a timely manner for recording. In fact, it was over 2 years late. Therefore, this item 's payment date should be reflected correctly on my credit report. If so, it will be well past the seven year threshold for removal. Companies that wield as much power over consumers as does Equifax should be held to an extremely high standard. In my opinion, the company falls well below such a standard. They have not gone beyond a cursory check of public records to examine the evidence I 've provided and report this item correctly in my credit file. This practice is resulting in derogatory information on my credit report which should not be included. The XXXX has attempted to help me twice to correct their error. I want Equifax to do the right thing and correct my report. Reference docs uploaded : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 ) Official check for payment 2 ) 'Release of State Tax Execution ' updated with correct payment date 3 ) Letter from XXXX stating correct payment dateI received an phone call regarding this debt that was 5 years old this account was open with out my acknowledgment this company have been harassing my call many times and some time for an different phone number I told them this account was not step up by me so I 'm not responsible for this.Bank : Chase Bank Name : XXXX ( representative im talking to today ) Amount : {$27000.00} My account was closed without my knowledge and they claim they mailed a check to an address I dont live at. Needed to fill out a change of address form and get it notarized which I did. Reason for denial : Did not know a check number that was never sent to me. XX/XX/2018 - Visited branch to inquire about previous visit where I filled out and notarized the change of address form -- > XXXX XXXX location XX/XX/2018 - XXXX XXXX location -- initially filled out form and notarized it.my daughter was ill 120 days behind on my payments - had the full amount to pay on the card for XXXX XXXX 2016 went to pay the full bill was put on hold. rep came back and said if i did not pay XXXX more that i would just incur fees after the payment was made. stated that was all i had - gave her my credit card numbers to pay the bill was put on hold again - she stated that she was trying to help me and she would be right back. came back and said that she wishes to charge my account off - i said no and further explained that i thought i had protection on the card the bill is due for XX/XX/XXXX and im paying it on XX/XX/XXXX so if your stating its an extra XXXX im paying until XX/XX/XXXX and then resuming my payments as my balance will be around XXXX remaining on hold again -she stated that its to late i charged off now. and that i need to pay XXXX dollars for the next XXXX months - i asked why and was told that that is my payoff - i said what did i spend on the card she said XXXX dollars which is impossible when i recieved the card it had a balance i had to pay - i had almost a XXXX XXXX dollar chargefrom the company. she said i was responsible for XXXX percent of the full bill. i never even recived a statement from this company - i said if your charging me off put it in writing i was told no and that this was a one time deal and if i did not do it now that it would not stand. i disconnected the call what company refuses to take your payments after agreeing to tells you whats in your best interests and then bullies you into an agreement to ruin your credit on purpose - i was paying and was allowed and then straight out told you are forced to charge offThis is in rebuttal to response from original complaint # XXXX. First off, I find it offensive and insulting that in the response to my original complaint, you essentially call me a liar as indicated by ( and I quote ) '' Mr. XXXX mentioned that he believed this was used by an " unauthorized user '' and also that " it seems unlikely that an unauthorized user would continue to pay on the account '' .You see, unlike you, it is not what I speculate or guess to be, it is instead, what I know. It seems to me that your respondent must truly feel a high degree of certainty that he/she is correct. When in fact, I can assure you, that you do not know my personal circumstances and what events have caused this debt to be what it is. Stick to the facts and the facts are this - you still have not complied with my request for itemized charges, signatures and dates of purchase so that I may differentiate charges that I know to be mine and then those that are unauthorized. Did it ever occur to you people that the unauthorized user may be somebody close to me and that knew me intimately and also knew how to make payments enough to avoid detection? Or maybe, I kept paying the monthly bill not paying close attention to the increasing amount? At any rate, you seem to have it all figured out..except for the part where you comply with my request to simply get itemized charges and dates. I find it aggravating and frustrating that after repeated attempts, I still am not getting what I have repeatedly requested. In fact, it seems now to have become a game and a personal attack on me. Why do n't you people simply provide what I have asked for and quit playing your little games. Again and again and again ... XXXX, I do not dispute that the account is mine. I simply want documentation of itemized charges and the dates of purchase. Why do I want these? I want these because in order for me to submit a police report or affidavit, I need these to show the facts. Can I be any clearer? Also in closing, your response states that you included documents to support your response which include a debt validation letter, a credit card application and lastly, billing statements. TO WHOM, I DID NOT GET ANYTHING? In fact, what good do any of these do for me anyway? I already said that I acknowledge being the owner of the account. The statements do n't show itemized charges and dates of purchase. DO YOU KNOW THAT NOT ONCE HAS THERE BEEN ANY ATTEMPT TO PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH YOUR FRAUD UNIT OR REQUEST A FRAUD AFFIDAVIT FROM ME. I have had to do this with a few other situations on my credit and they kindly listen to me, acknowledge my situation and give me advice and directions on how to obtain the information I am looking for. And do you know that as a result of this, they have acknowledged the unauthorized use on these accounts and have since remedied the situation. BUT NOT YOU! I ca n't even get detailed information from you and then on top of it, you make judgements and attack me personally. I 'm giving you one last opportunity to give me the information I am requesting or I will take legal action against your firm. Hopefully, this is something you can understand?Fifth 3rd Bank has listed in credit reports that both my wife and I have missed 8 payments. In fact we have not missed even one without their instructing us that under the modification program we eventually qualified for, we could skip up to 2 Two payments. All other payments were made. In phone communications with them, I was told they were refusing to do anything about the false report until we served them with proof that the credit bureaus contacted them and then gave us 5th 3rd Banks written reply. XXXX  immediately removed the false report from their listing. XXXX took my complaint three separate times and only sent back emails stating that the process was completed, but not once reporting what was the reply. In a fourth contact, by phone, they would not give the reply verbally and stated I would get a written copy in 3 to 10 business days. That was over three weeks ago. Now, by phone, they tell me I am no longer able to confirm who I am to begin any discussion of 5th3rds response or what happened to the promised written reply. The History of bad faith on the Bank 's part is atrocious, including attempts to foreclose illegally and refusing to remove PMI as required when debt went way under 80 % of value. Then, after removing it in the modification, they just arbitrarily add it.I have been on hold for 1.5 housr trying to cancel my credit card.

I have a case number for reporting this on XXXX XXXX, and XXXX, 2016. case number is XXXX. I deposited {$25.00} on XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX and tried to deposit more, it kept spitting out the money. Today they gave me XXXX overdraft fees of {$36.00} each. When I just spoke to them, even if it would have taken all the cash, now their committing fraud again ( I was already in a class action law suit against them for accepting checks before deposits ). Now their trying to tell me that depositing the {$25.00} went after they let checks come through. I have the receipt to prove the balance at the time of the deposit. This is why there was a class action law suit against them. Their trying to tell me that after XXXX all cash deposits through the atms are for the next business day. I was told that all deposits are put in the account immediately. Not only did they not put the deposit in immediately, but they put the incoming checks in before the deposit. There is a law that they should follow, that the deposits coming in that business day go into the account before the incoming checks! I want the XXXX {$36.00} fees reversed ASAP.I would like to request the suppression of the following items from my credit report, which are the result of my falling victim to identity theft. This information does not relate to [ transactions that I have made/accounts that I have opened ], as the attached supporting documentation can attest. As such, it should be blocked from appearing on my credit report pursuant to section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.Navient employees are repeatedly calling and leaving messages on phone numbers I have asked them to remove and do not call ....Re : Complaint Against Bank of America Institution On XX/XX/XXXX I received a personal check in the amount of {$100.00}. I have the Bank of America App on my Smartphone device and I used this app to deposit the check into my checking account as I normally do when receiving a personal check. The only difference is that I split the check to put {$50.00} into checking and {$50.00} into my savings account. I received a confirmation that this had been done. Two days later while checking my account I found that the monies did not go into either account but instead Bank of America took {$100.00} out of my savings and {$100.00} out of my checking account and then placed a hold on both accounts.It took two days and multiple calls and even visiting a local branch before theyd agree to put my monies back into my account that they illegally took out. Mind you though that they still had a hold on my check. At the advice of the rep I spoke to over the phone, the suggestion was made that I go into the bank and present the physical check to them and the hold would come off, but this never happened. The took my physical check and deposited and a day later I found it was rejected and that the initial 10-day hold would still be in effect. The monies from the check has come out the account of the person that gave me the check over a week ago and Bank of America is still insisting on holding the check until XX/XX/XXXX. The reason they are holding the check is merely because I tried to split the check between two accounts. Their app allowed me to do this and even gave me a confirmation that it was done.I called again today and spoke with a supervisor who called their Risk Department and I was advised that they couldnt release my funds because they didnt have a good image of the check. This upset me because it was a lie. They had perfect image from my phone deposit and they have the physical check from the bank.My main concern and contention is that if were not allowed to split checks why does your banking app initially allow it? Why wouldnt you put a disclaimer on the site, so your customers dont have to go thru this? And if this is the banking institutions failure why as the consumer must we suffer for it? And heres the biggest thing. Bank of America has had my XXXX for over a week making interest off it and refusing to give it to me until theyre ready which will be XX/XX/XXXX. This is illegal and although its only a XXXX my rights are being violated and Im thinking of seeking legal counsel. The rep on the phone told me that this happens all the time, and she agreed that they should do something about it, but they dont? The reason they dont is because theyre benefiting. I want to make sure they dont do this to other people.Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX XXXXI sent {$13000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Coinbase Inc on XX/XX/XXXX, here is the receipt, We have successfully sent the following transfer : XXXX Item # : XXXX Amount : {$13000.00} To : Coinbase, Inc Fee : XXXX Send on Date : XX/XX/ Service : Same Day ********************************************* Coinbase owns XXXX, and it promised that " Bank wire transfers may be credited to your XXXX  account on the same day if submitted by XXXX PT.

Under Duress, I simple went ahead and paid off this account and now i'm looking at my credit report and I noticed that there is a bill reported from the same company of {$25.00}.

The debt in question provides no phone number or address to contact this creditor and equifax allows this information to be reported. From my understanding of the FCRA and address and phone is required to be on the report.

They did not notify me of this correctly and misinformed me that this payment had posted since payments made days after it had already posted successfully. They then charged me a  XXXX  dollar fee. When I asked them to remove it I had to speak to several customer agents. They then said they would call me back with an agent from their team to resolve these disputes and never did. Total scammers.This is a complaint from XXXX XXXX against Client Services for Client Services 's failure to provide requested information for the debt alleged. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, Consumer, XXXX, received a demand letter from creditor, Client Services. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, consumer ( through legal counsel ) responded with a written request for documentation, including the following : a. Signed copy of the original contact ( s ) ; b. Any notice ( s ) of assignment or receipt of sale of the debt alleged ; c. Any notice ( s ) of delinquency ; d. Ledgers/spreadsheets/accounting statements showing how the debt alleged was accrued ( including any fees and interest charges added to this debt ) ; e. A copy of your debt collection rights license ; f. Proof that you are licensed to collect this debt in Arizona ; and g. Any other documentation which tends to show validity. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 Creditor responded with old billing statements, but no chain of title or other documentation proving legal authority. Creditor 's failure to respond to a consumer 's good faith request for documentation makes it impossible for the consumer to make an informed decision regarding the debt alleged. This is a violation of USC 1692, and other federal acts which require lenders and debt collectors to act in good faith and refrain from unfair deceptive or abusive acts.I receive numerous calls daily to my cell and work phone from Profit service group Collections agency employee XXXX from phone # XXXX. I have verbalized to her collection agency to not call me or my job and that I cant take calls at my place of employment. Also my account is not in collection with that company. The medical account in question is being paid directly to XXXX XXXX medical billing department. XXXX XXXX have also notified Profit service group collection agency to not call me because my account is being collected in their office and it is not in collection.XXXX states that she will continue to call me no matter what. THIS IS ILLEGAL BECAUSE SHE CONTINUES TO CONSTANTLY HARRASS ME!!!!!!!! I HAVE MY CALL LOGS FROM MY CELL AND JOB AS PROOF OF CALLS I RECEIVE BACK TO BACK. SHE WILL HANG UP AND REDIAL MY NUMBER SEVERAL TIMES. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL IS THAT.I mailed a  Multiple Inquiry Removal Letter  by mail in order to dispute information, in regards to  XXXX  hard inquiries, that was being reported on my credit report. As soon as they received the letter The request that I submitted included  XXXX  Hard Inquiries that were not factual and I received the same response for ALL inquiries, which was " Inquiries are a factual record of file access. If you believe this was unauthorized, please contact the creditor. '' According  to the FCRA Rules, FCRA 623 ( b ) ( 2 ) and 611 ( a ) ( 1 ), it states that any information can be disputed and MUST be i nvestigated and if you do not investigate AND respond, the CRA must delete the disputed information from its files. The fact that I received a response 4 days after the receipt of my c letter, one can assume that there was no investigation into the matter. I plan to purchase a home this year and having this many hard inquiries on my credit report display as a sign of financial trouble, when this is not the case. I am submitting this complaint due to the lack of investigation into my original dispute for hard inquiries that does not belong to me. I did not sign for anything. This is unfair practices by a credit reporting agency with no concern for the credit worthiness of a consumer.I have been a victim of identity theft.TD Bank only has available branches in certain states. I was moving out of state for a job, went to the branch to close my account, but was persuaded to keep my account open based on their mobile deposit feature that would allow me to deposit my check and be available next business day. Now, I am several hours away from the nearest TD Bank branch, and they are holding my check for 4 days preventing deposit. The Mobile App where you deposit the check states that if deposited before XXXX it will be available same day, if deposited after XXXX it will be AVAILABLE next business day. The branch I was at is open 7 days a week and advised me that they consider non holiday weekends as business days. I gave them the flexibility that perhaps that was that specific branch, and the money would be available on Monday. It is now monday and they are telling me that that is wrong, and the money is not available, despite being told by their branch manager, and their mobile app that they money should be available. The previous mobile deposit I made was available to me next day, but only half of it, the other half was mysteriously put on hold, in which case the representative advised me he " did n't know why, but it should be available either tomorrow or the day after. '' It was eventually available to me, but they have yet to produce a reason for holding over XXXX dollars of my money in contradiction to their own written policy. I was also advised that the branch can push through the deposit and make it available to me today, but customer service can not -- again without explanation. I was told my only option was to drive several hours to the nearest branch and ask them to push through the deposit to make funding available to me.I applied for XXXX discharge through XXXX to have my student loans forgiven. A debt collection company called Pioneer sent me a letter they were taking over my loans and they were adding a XXXX collection fee.Pretty much I contacted the credit bureaus in regards to them having to show proof of account being mine Transunion has failed to do so and they keep sending the same letter to me over and over. The law states that if they can not provide me with valid proof of account collection being my debt they must delete it from my credit report file. It has been 2 months going on 3 months of trying to work with them on providing me with proof and they have not done so. In the following attachments I am sending everything I have since the day I contacted them and also the letters I sent and what I have gotten in return. Also receipts.I am a XXXX XXXX old unemployed and XXXX individual who is trying to start up a new business. It would be a consulting business run by my sons and using my years of experience and lessons learned to advise organizations on how to quickly solve ongoing problems while making their employees happy. I started to organize the new business, never having owned my own business before, by using on-line companies who help new businesses get started. I started by using XXXX to create an LLC. They recommended using XXXX to do the accounting work for my new business. Then It was recommended that I use Bank of America 's Small Business Banking Services to help me start using XXXX XXXX ( which was new to me ) and Checking. So I contacted them explaining I had never had my own business before and was n't sure what to do. Bank of America had me talk to a number of people in different departments to get started, but it was a confusing and complicated process, and I was never sure what was going on, and told them so. Then, having conducted no business at all with them or anyone connected to them, Bank of America sent me a notice that I had overdrawn my account and owed them money. I tried calling to clear up this error on their part but kept getting transferred to other people. Now I have a bill in the mail saying I still owe them for overdrawing my account. I am attaching their latest warning with this application for help. Thank you very much. XXXX XXXXI am contacting you all because on XXXX2017 I paid a debt and the original creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX turned the payment over to collections and fraudulently provided LCA ( Lanier Collection Agency and Services, INC ) with my banking account information to take the money from my account instead of applying it to my account balance. I have included the certified mail receipt and copy of the authorization mailed to XXXX XXXX XXXX After that I waited for the debit to come through it was n't until XXXX/2017 that the debit came through but it hit as a charge from LCA. At the time I did n't know who that was until the bank told me. I then filed a complaint with my bank of an unauthorized transaction by this LCA, as I have no business with them nor have I ever heard of them. I sent authorization to XXXX XXXX to collect a debt and they did n't get it so I thought. So the bank refunded my bank account when I advised them of this. They told me they were n't able to stop the payment so as a result they closed the card associated with the transaction and paid this company who stole from my account because XXXX XXXX gave them my banking information. So on XXXX XXXX  2017 I paid the original creditor via bill pay sent by my bank as a check to settle the debt and again XXXX XXXX sent the check to LCA. I found this out when I received the check mailed to the original creditor in an envelope from LCA stating it is not acceptable as you will see in the documentation I 'm uploading. Therefore LCA is reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus in an effort to harm my credibility. I paid this account to the original creditor upon being notified of the balance. They maliciously sent the payment to LCA not once but twice in an effort to discredit me. It is n't right. LCA has already stolen from me and now they have the audacity to report a paid debt to an original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as a collection when they know this creditor actually gave them money for a paid account. I have never and will never do business with a collection agency because I pay my bills when I am informed of them. Plain and simple I knew there was a bill and I paid it and LCA has clearly violated FCRA regulations by reporting to a third party a debt they know is paid in an effort to assist XXXX XXXX XXXX with this fraudulent claim of debt. I demand that LCA remove this fraudulent and illegal information from my credit report. The account has been paid to XXXX XXXX twice and here is the proof sent to me by LCA from the original creditor. I have never had any business with LCA and will not. I 'm not liable for how an original creditor handle payments and aside from this LCA is reporting inaccurate amounts. I owed and paid {$94.00} to XXXX XXXX not the {$95.00} they are reporting.I recently got a copy of my TransUnion credit report.. Upon review of my credit report, I found that there is an inaccurate and unverified bankruptcy on my report.This has negatively impacted my ability to receive credit and has resulted in unnecessary embarrassment and inconvenience. As stated in Section 609 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, ( 2 ) ( E ) : A consumer reporting agency is not required to remove accurate derogatory information from a consumer 's file unless the information is outdated under Section 609 or can not be verified. As is my right, I am requesting verification of the bankruptcy reported on my credit report. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.We ( my late husband & I ) owned property which was in his & his brothers name. Financed thru BofA, sold to Green Tree and now DiTech. After my husbands death I ended up owning the property XXXX %. It is rental property and I make all of the payments, etc. Yes, I have been late on several payments but always catch them up and pay any late charge associated with them. I just received a call from DiTech saying that they received my XX/XX/XXXX payment, but would not be applying it to the loan, as it was not the total amount due. I asked what the extra amount was for, please break it down for me and she said she could only give me limited amount of information on the account and she would not be applying my payment. My husband has been deceased for 7 years and I have always spoken with this and previous companies regarding the loan and payments. They have had my brother-in-laws permission to speak to me regarding anything to do with this loan for many years. Even though I always pay any late fees, if I am not mistaken, the original loan papers say any outstanding late fees, etc. will be added to the end of the payment schedule/final payment. How can a financial institution treat and threaten paying customers in this manner? Is this legal?Chase Credit Card Dept sent me a solicitation to upgrade my XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card to a Premier XXXX Rewards Credit Card in XXXX 2015. They promised me XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX if I charged {$2000.00} with them in 90 days. I called them on XXXX XXXX or so and spoke with an agent who approved me for the upgrade without a credit report since I was already a customer, provided I spend {$2000.00} on the card in 90 days. I spent {$4000.00} in the time period and questioned them many times for my XXXX miles. I was told by many agents that I was approved and the marketing dept would send me the XXXX miles to my SouthWest Airline Rapid Rewards account. Nothing happened. I filed a complaint with their Executive Offices and Chase just blew me off. Finally last week an executive office agent named XXXX stated she reviewed the tape recording of XXXX XXXX conversation with me and I was correct that an offer was made to me and I did fulfill the requirements BUT, she said the agent told me I could not get a Premium card without Chase securing a new credit report. I ASKED TO HEAR A COPY OF THE XXXX XXXX CONVERSATION BUT CHASE SAID I NEED TO SUE THEM AND FILE A SUBPOENA TO HEAR THE TAPE. Another rep said the agent on XXXX/XXXX/15 conversation made a mistake. I followed the solicitation and did what I was told. I want my XXXX airmiles as promised. We had a deal and the tape recording proves it. I want a copy of the recording and my miles and an apology from Chase.I have a hard inquiry on my credit report from XXXX. I do not know or have I authorized such inquiries! Please take this off my report as soon as possible! Thank you! XXXXMy parents did a reverse mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. My dad XXXX 5 years ago and my mom just XXXX a year ago XX/XX/XXXX. I am the sole heir and the only family member left. I had been living with mom for 3 years taking care of her. This has been my childhood house since XXXX grade! Long story short, I got my name on the house and have a buyer who is waiting for the payoff amount and the mortgage company refuses to give it to me. The house goes up for auction XX/XX/XXXX and i am still not able to contact them. They have given me wrong numbers and i have left messages every day and they have yet to return my calls. I have been trying to reach them since the XX/XX/XXXX. They will not give me a payoff in a timely manner. The sale is due on the XX/XX/XXXX and foreclosure is the XX/XX/XXXX.This is very stressful for myself and the buyer and I originally tried talking to them in XX/XX/XXXX and I could not talk to a manager or anyone in a higher position. They lost my paperwork and I had to resend it. I also noticed that my mother 's name is misspelled on the Notice of Trustee 's Sale document. They have purposely delayed things so I am in jeopardy of losing everything. This is unprofessional and very unfair. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is also involved in the matter. Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter,My XXXX bankruptcy case was never XXXX. I reopened my bankruptcy case in XXXX of XXXX and amended the file to include additional debt that I incurred. Plaza services was notified by the bankruptcy court on XXXX XXXX of XXXX. I have since also sent communication to Plaza Services in XXXX, on XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. I keep getting information stating that they deny my dispute and are continuing to try and collect this debt. I am trying to raise my XXXX XXXX and they keep reporting this as an active collection and I can not .get them to correct the debt to show as included in my bankruptcy. I have also contacted XXXX.My name is XXXX XXXX, and Transunion is reporting a dismissed bankruptcy on my credit report. I received notification that the bankruptcy was removed from my credit file. After removing it, Transunion put it back on my credit report. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Transunion is supposed to notify me within five business days of adding and removing anything from my credit file. Transunion has failed to do this, so I am requesting that the Bankruptcy is permanently removed from my credit file. After reviewing my Transunion credit report, I noticed that the public record does not include my name, address and either my social security number. None of this information is showing on my Transunion credit report regarding my public record, so I would like the bankruptcy to be removed. I would also like an updated credit report once this is done.I disputed a late payments on my credit report that were showing from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. As a result of the investigation the status did not correct the late payments. But instead it changed my status from Paid with having the late payments to a Charge off. I was totally confused by this because my truck was paid off in XXXX of XXXX. So I contacted the bureaus and they stated the charge of was I XXXX of XXXX. I sent the bureaus proof which were bank statements that showed I made the payments to XXXX. I also sent the same bank statements and disputed it with XXXX. The bureaus continue to sent me result letters stating that the information is verified by the creditor. They are ignoring the fact that I showed them the bank statements showing I paid the truck off. The bank statements show payments made in the month they show late payments and charged off. This is not Fair.While reviewing my credit report, I noticed an unauthorized and fraudulent inquiries initiated by CITIZENS ONE AUTO FINANCE on XXXX XXXX. I did not authorize employees of CITIZEN ONE AUTO FINANCE to review my credit report at any time. I have requested that CITIZEN ONE provide me with any signed documents to validate this inquiry within 5 business days and they have failed to do so. The inquiries into my credit profile without my clear written authorization is in violation of my FRCA and Privacy Rights. I am requesting that CITIZEN ONE AUTO FINAANCE contact ALL credit Reporting agencies to permanently dele these adverse information as they directly have resulted in my inability to obtain new credit or employment and Housing.XXXX XXXX called me with misleading information advising if I paid them {$100.00} a month for 4 months they would remove all collection debt from my credit report. They asked me for more than one credit card with the 3 digits on the back of my card. I know this is against the law. Then they gave me a fake credit score and credit rating. XXXX extension XXXX out of XXXX, UT location stated his corparte location is XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT advised me I had to pay him for up to 4 months to have things removed off my credit that has already been paid and unpaid. I ask to have the vaidility of his comnpany sent to me in writing or by email. He had my business email address which I have never given him or used on any of my personal accounts. When I rewquested to have it removed he still sent an email to mu business account and not my personal account. Then when I called the comapny back they stated there is no employee there by that name or extension I am requesting to have this looked into I think I am a victim of fraud and idenity theftAn unidentified law firm representing GE Money Bank called from a blocked number stating their processor has failed at delivering documents pertaining to a civil suit case that is being handled by said firm. The person with whom I spoke said her name was XXXX but did not give any information about the firm she was calling for or give me any contact information. She threatened that her firm was going to follow through with a civil suit to obtain a default judgment. The account in question is not mine and I have no knowledge of this account 's existence. XXXX stated the account was closed XX/XX/XXXX, meaning that the statue of limitations to sue expired XX/XX/XXXX. Upon bringing this fact to her attention, she continued to threaten me that they were still going to follow through with the suit. She hung up without any further correspondence. I was never told where this case would be filed, nor how to get in contact with anyone to investigate the matter further. This account has never appeared on my credit report, nor have I had anyone in the past make any attempt to contact me.Inquiries are not mine. Thank You!CITI Bank I Payment On timeclosed my account without notice or confirmation. Account Type : Flexible Spending Credit card Date opened : XX/XX/XXXX Hight Balance : {$3000.00} ( I payment on time, Why have Hight Balance??? )I received a credit alert on XX/XX/2018 that a new collection was reported as derogatory on my credit report. It shows AD ASTRA RECOVERY SERV. I am unaware of who that company is and I have requested VALIDATION of the debt but have not received anything. I have tried calling the company and only got the run around. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), they are required by federal law to verify - through the physical  verification of the original signed consumer contract - any and all accounts you post on a credit report. Otherwise, anyone paying for reporting services could fax, mail or email in a fraudulent account. I demand to see Verifiable Proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my Signature on it ) you have on file of the accounts mentioned. Failure to positively verify these accounts has hurt my ability to obtain a home mortgage loan. Under the FCRA, unverified accounts must be removed and if AD ASTRA RECOVER SERV are unable to provide me a copy of verifiable proof, they must remove the account being mentioned immediatelyI received a misleading email making it seem like my account was overdue and they offered special programs including taking my tax refund to cover a payment/partial payment. In the email it includes this line underlined and in italics " If you 're getting a tax refund, put those funds to good use - bring your account current to stop the late fees and collection calls. '' My payment is due XX/XX/XXXX. I received this predatory and misleading email today, XX/XX/XXXX. My account is not overdue, but the red highlighted " alerts '' and request for my tax refund were still sent to me? Not ok.In XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I had a XXXX XXXX XXXX Account ( Not sure if it was credit or checking honestly ) that was charged up by an ex. That debt was paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. Today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I got a call about that debt of XXXX something dollars from XXXX XXXX XXXX who claimed to be representing Pyramid Acquisitions. This is probably the 40th call I 've received from somebody claiming to own that debt even though I paid it 12 years ago. The harassment over a paid off debt has gotten to the point that I can expect someone else claiming to own it to come up every 6 months or so. I 'm constantly having to dispute it on my credit reports, which is a pain in the rear. I ca n't keep doing this, I ca n't keep having to re-provide the same information over and over again. I do not know where " Pyramid Acquisitions '' got this phony debt.. .nor do I know how XXXX XXXX Solutions of XXXX , South Carolina got it, but someone needs to put an end to these kind of practices. Trying to collect on a debt that has been paid and reporting it to credit bureaus way past the statute of limitations should be illegal. I 'm sure it probably is, but it is n't stopping these companies from acting on it.On XXXX/XXXX/2016 I received a letter from Convergent Outsourcing , Inc. claiming that they were collecting on behalf of XXXX XXXX , XXXX for an alleged debt of {$300.00}, but were willing to settle for {$100.00}. Concerned about identity theft I checked my XXXX account to confirm what I suspected, no charges to my account with a {$0.00} balance. This appears to be a scam purporting debt on unsuspecting victims.Unauthorized Credit Inquiry : XX/XX/2017 Chase Card XXXX, DE XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXXI received a summons and complaint from a process server stating I was being sued by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ca bar # XXXX. I was server at my place of residence where I have resided for almost two years. Attached to the complaint is a letter mailed to a address other than mine. I never received and letter to my place of abode. The plaintiff never attempted to resolve this matter without taking action, but false claims to have in there complaint. The current and original creditor is n't listed on any documents and again no documents or communication was made with me. I was denied my rights to dispute.O XXXX/XXXX/15 I submitted a grievance letter to my loan Servicer and Note holder and had a CFPB case number XXXX. They responded with a a letter regarding their services and being correct and to deal with my home builder on my grievances and did not address the specific questions regarding the transaction of my note. My grievance letter was very specific with mortgage broker fraud and appraisal fraud and predatory loan issues using bank statements for stated income and many other issues relating to the origination of the note and the transactions of the note to present. I sent a follow up letter in the portal to get my specific questions answered. They never responded to my second letter. I called the servicer and spoke with the point person assigned to my file. The point person stated, they closed the file and the compliance office will not speak direct to me and stated, this complaint file was closed and issue was addressed in their view. The point person said, maybe you should file another complaint, but this file is closed. I called CPFB, and asked if the file was closed. They stated they can only close the file, and to pursue this with a attorney and the FTC monitors the files and if they see something they will contact you. I can not afford an attorney at this time and now filling another complaint to get my grievances answered. As a consumer I am entitled to receive answers on my grievances made. It appears this is going to be a run around with my grievance, but I will keep trying to I get answers to my specific questions. I have followed the process as it was set up for, me, the consumer. Hopefully the other side with take time to address my grievances raised and provide their answers to my questions regarding my mortgage that I raised in my letter. I have also contacted my State Attorney Office with my grievances and my State Banking regulators with my grievances to see if they will address. I also sent to XXXX Federal agencies including this XXXX, my letter and the Servicer for the Note Holder letter response, to have a my grievances be addressed. I look forward the parties use this portal under the Federal government to have issues addressed for the consumer, such as I.My statement of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX showed an item of " XXXX XXXX XXXX {$490.00} '' adding to my statement. The first time that this {$490.00} showed on my statement was in XX/XX/XXXX. And I didn't recognize it, since it was saying the {$490.00} was for XXXX, but I never had a XXXX account. And I was in XXXX during the period of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and I couldn't use this card in XXXX. Clearly, it was a fraud. I reported this dispute of {$490.00} to the bank and they were pretty helpful and gave back my money. But on my XXXX 's statement, this {$490.00} together with other transactions ( I recognized and paid for those ones ) showed again. I called the bank. They told me after investigation, this transaction was made by XXXX and the bank didn't recognize it as a fraud anymore. BUT, I don't even have XXXX and I wasn't able to use Discover Card in XXXX. The bank told me that they would go through another investigation of my case. It has been two months since I reported the issue. And I haven't had any feedback from the bank yet.i have tried to get my free annual credit report from the bureaus but they refuse to issue me one because i d'ont live at the address on my licence.please help in concerning this matter cause i need to know any negative items on my credit report.XXXX XXXX XXXX reported that I failed to pay in XX/XX/XXXX on account that was closed in XX/XX/XXXX and included in my chapter XXXX bankruptcy. I disputed this information with Experian in XX/XX/XXXX and they responded back that the information reported on my report was wrong and they corrected it. The next day the wrong information was put back on my credit report. I then contacted Experian about the problem on the phone and they agreed they were in the wrong and would delete the information after a new dispute. Again they investigated the information and removed the negative mark, then the next day it was put back on my report. I believe Experian is now in violation of FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( ii ) for reinserting this incorrect information, not once but twice.XX/XX/2017 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University Dear Account Technology Inc, I am writing in response to your letter I received dated XX/XX/XXXX, because I do not believe I owe any debt, so do not understand why you would be contacting me.

XXXX XXXXOn XX/XX/XXXX, I arrived at my residence letter from my bankruptcy lawyers indicating the action that the popular bank against me is taking in the bankruptcy court informing me that they want to charge {$150.00} for lawyer services for indicating changes in the mortgage payment. For my state of bankruptcy submitted and in defense my lawyers inform me the situation and I do not agree with this action of the bank because for all the years that I carry my mortgage nonca I was charged for such information for such reason I raise this complaint towards the banking entityattempting to collect 30 % collection costs, no agreement. collecting an invalid debt, debt does not exist.MONTEREY FINANCIAL XXXX WRONGFUL COLLECTIONS PRACTICES FOR THE PAID IN FULL ACCOUNT WITH FAILURE TO VALIDATE THE ACCOUNT WITH DETAILSI was a victim of identity theft fraud and I have filed multiple disputes with this company and the credit bureau, yet it remains on my credit.This started from my landlord retaliating against us after we attempted to get the home energy efficient and we spoke with the Commerce Dept.. They contacted him. He 's a poor excuse of a landlord cuz upon move in he made me do all the cleaning. We got to the point of receiving a 2nd unlawful detainer, and we 're evicted XX/XX/XXXX then : A 3rd party collector gets involved, who made no attempts to contact me prior to the garnishment.!!! In XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that I was being garnished, I discovered that it was XXXX XXXX XXXX located out of XXXX. I sent a letter immediately for proof of the debt, validation & the amounts. It went unawnsered. I am frustrated because I 'm not able to get a statement to show the balance, payments and credits. The case # used is for a paid case. Previously, XXXX XXXX, was atty. of record and we took in a large cashiers check to pay the amount owing. We requested a copy of the receipt & copy of the check from XXXX office but have not gotten it yet. I did not get notified of the transfer to Credit International hearing or the wage garnishment. It appears that they sent my paperwork to a erroneous address. Furthermore, the garnishor has illegally withheld our personal items that we had in the garage and failed to return our last months deposit/security or a detailed statement. Please investigate this matter and determine if I overpaid this 2nd judgement. I pray that you will get the answers that I 've tried to obtain. Case # XXXX this is the correct case #. The case # XXXX had been paid except minor atty costs of {$300.00} approx. Otherwise on the XXXX XXXX day it would have showed all that 's owed to him.Greetings! I have recently filed a complaint with CFPB, case # XXXX, and have receive a very unclear response. Since the company in question, CITI BANK does not reply to my follow up, not XXXX XXXX XXXX has ever picked up the phone, I am submitting another letter with more precise follow up questions. To recap : my XXXX credit card application was denied solely for the reason of my citizenship and/or immigration status. XXXX XXXX, please, address the following questions with as much precision as you can to help me fully understand the reason for the inability of your company to continue with the process : 1. In your original letter, you mentioned that " due to the United States laws and regulations pertaining to transactions with or in XXXX ''. QUESTION 1 : what laws and regulations you are referring to? Please, cite names and numbers, if applicable, so I can familiarize with them. NOTE : I have never heard of any such U.S. laws as I presently have and had in the past credit cards with all major banks. QUESTION 2 : if such laws and regulations exist, are other banks exempt from them? 2. I would like to clarify the actual reason for the denial. To my knowledge, the bank is NOT making transactions WITH XXXX, NOR IN XXXX. I am a private citizen and live in the US for many years, I am a resident of this country and pay taxed as a resident. The back of the letter you sent me explicitly states that ECOA prohibits discrimination based on many factors, including national origin, provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract. In my opinion, my credit records do show my capabilities and trustworthiness, unless you can present a reason why you would think otherwise. QUESTION 3 : how come your sole reason for the denial is my citizenship/immigration status? Isn't that a direct violation of the ECOA laws? I say : look at my credit score, not my passport! 3. I was speaking several times with CITI BANK representatives and have been told repeatedly that CITI does not discriminate, even though in my mind, this is a direct discrimination based on citizenship status. QUESTION 4 : to help me better understand the discriminatory policy, please, provide a hypothetical example, where your company would indeed discriminate someone based on the same factor. 4. QUESTION 5 : does CITI BANK have a unified policy towards ALL applicants? What I mean is whether any non-US citizen or XXXX XXXX holder is not able to obtain a XXXX credit card? Or Ukrainian citizens are in a specific list, for which CITI BANK does not want to open accounts? Thank you.We had an existing Mortgage loan through XXXX XXXX XXXX that originated in XX/XX/XXXX. It was purchased, to our knowledge, in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, unknown to us, we were one month behind on our payments to XXXX due to a missed payment in XX/XX/XXXX due to an Illness. The payment was overlooked and we were never contacted by XXXX by letter, email or phone to be able to address the Issue and make the missed payment. We have since learned about the missed payment after hiring Council. Only then did Seterus inform us of the missed payment. We have since rectified the missed payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2600.00}. We also gave Seterus specific instructions in writing on the cashiers check that the money was to go to the XX/XX/XXXX missed payment or was not to be cashed. Seterus refused to abide by the instructions on the check and cashed the check anyway. When ask why, they explained that wasnt the way they did their accounting and the money was placed into a existing Suspense Account. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  notified us by letter that the loan had been purchased and we were to begin making our payments to Seterus in XX/XX/XXXX. We never received any correspondence from Seterus at that time. We didnt receive a new contract to sign so we assumed Seterus had adopted the same contract we had with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We complied with the letter from XXXX and set up an account on the Seterus Website and began making our payments on XX/XX/XXXX even though we hadnt received a statement from Seterus at the time. It wasnt until after we had made XXXX payment, that we received XXXX statement from Seterus. They had Immediately began charging us a late fee and demanded a {$7900.00} payment that was due XX/XX/XXXX. When we contacted them about the amount, their response was that we had missed our  XXXX payment and we also had to reimburse them for the Escrow disbursement of {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. We explained to them at that time, our payment had been made on-line to them on XX/XX/XXXX as we were instructed to do. We also explained that the Escrow payment should have come from our existing Escrow account with XXXX. Those explanations fell on deaf ears. We received our first of three statements for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX showing we owed {$7900.00} for XXXX payment. This statement also included prior activity with Seterus, although we had never done business with before, showing a XXXX payment and XXXX payment of {$2600.00} respectively. The Statement also showed two Tax Disbursement made on XX/XX/XXXX for  {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. Money, we thought, should have come from funds in our Escrow account  with XXXX. After visiting our Tax Assessor about the Issue, the Tax Assessor explained to us that only two payments had been recorded to our account on XX/XX/XXXX. Both being by Seterus. Meaning that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not make our XX/XX/XXXX tax payment and were still in possession of account funds or Seterus was withholding Escrow funds and refusing to tell us and then demanding we pay them for the dispersed funds. Only after a Escrow Account statement showing a {$7800.00} surplus, did Seterus acknowledge the existence of the funds and after request from council, still refused to refund us our money until we had paid them what they said we owed them. Money that was never owed to them in the first place.Seterus continues to engage in unscrupulous tactics to get us to pay money that is not owed to them. Seterus continually threatens to foreclose on our home every month and continually sends us unsolicited offers for a Loan Modification that we have never requested, wanting to lower our payments by extending our note to forty years. Seterus continues to harm our credit rating by reporting us late on our payments which has caused us unneeded expenses. We are unable to refinance our Mortgage at the present lower interest rate because of this also. They refuse to acknowledge our Attorney and our Accountant, that we have paid hundreds of dollars for, even after Seterus was sent documentation by our CPA verifying their mistake.We respectfully request your help in rectifying this unfortunate issue as soon as possible so we may be able to go on with our lives without fear of having our home taken from us and our credit continually being ruined.Please see attached documentation verifying our claims.i had XXXX collection accounts removed XXXX and XXXX and XXXX closed account XXXX they was removed and then now they are back on my credit report and i never received my 5 day notice which is a fcra violationI want you to please get rid of this information as soon as possible, I am not related to Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy XXXX and notify me when you do this so I can go ahead and apply for the things I have to apply for.Dear Sir or Madam, I am currently serving in the XXXX XXXX.

My pay check is XXXX, and the payment that I make to them is XXXX. I am struggling to break even every month. Also, I tried to enroll in the federal student loan forgiveness, they said that my private loan does not qualified to that program. I want to know that if that is true or they are just lies. Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXI'm currently Battling XXXX and have not been able to work. I Filed for an INCOME BASED repayment plan.

A month later I started getting " late payment " notifications and also started getting different due dates and amounts due????

Wondering how they got my private number when the only place I ut the information was on my application to the US Department of Education ( who forwarded it to Navient )??? Would like for Navient to honor what they sent me. No payment until XX/XX/XXXX. This will allow me time to fight my XXXX and hopefully get back to work.I have received repeated ( daily ) calls from XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. They call late at night because the company has outsourced debt collection to XXXX and representative do not know the time in United States. In addition, the representative that call and answer company 's phone use fake name to appear as if they are calling from the United States. They are rude, overbearing, and lack a demand of the English language to effective communicate. The company has given me the runaround in my attempt to get them to stop calling my home.I have asked Guardian Capital Management to validate a collection they are reporting on my credit reports on XXXX/XXXX/16 and they have failed to provide anything that would support the fact that they are attempting to collect on a debt without an agreement or contract. Nor have they supplied anything other than a statement on one of the collections. I told them that I would be reporting them to you but they obviously do n't fear you because they failed to delete themselves or answer questions about the debt ( s ) that they are using to damage me financially. Its damaging my credit and it is important to me.On XX/XX/2018 I checked my XXXX credit report, I notices two accounts on my report that not mine .I disputed this threes times with XXXX and they keep saying they verified accounts.

She said there was no annual fee the first year. The first time I used the card they billed me a {$59.00} annual fee. I called " Bank Of America '' and explained I was told the first year the fee was to be waived. Bank of America said they were " sorry for the misunderstanding '' but the fee stays.I have disputed this item with Experian for probably over a YEAR now and I have disputed it almost every other month. I just can't understand why someone doesn't actually read these disputes and tries to fix the problem. Rather than doing what needs to be done they simply look back at an old dispute and update my record from there. Problem is they are " UpDating '' it with wrong information which has caused me to NOT be able to obtain insurance thru XXXX XXXX and to pay higher rates with my current carrier as well as be denied credit with several different lenders/credit companies. XXXX XXXX XXXX..This account had a " Last Payment Date of XX/XX/2014, the account was closed and Written Off in XX/XX/2014 ... No further action was taken..

HOW can I have a RECENT MISSED PAYMENT in the LAST 60 days when I have not been late on ANY accounts within the past 5 years +- ... Attached are copies of my report showing the information. The INCORRECT information. When I call Experian I get told either Dont worry, it falls off in 7 years or We will dispute this for you. They simply cant understand what I am reporting.

XXXX   XXXX   To whom it concerns i recently pulled my credit report and noticed fraudulent errors dealing with the company 's listed above. I 've contacted these company 's by phone email and mailing certified letters. I have n't received any documents, phone calls nor emails from the banks, credit bureaus and The  XXXX . It has been over a period of five years since  XXXX /2012 and current. I 've asked the company 's to send verifiable documents of any signatures pertaining to me but i still have n't received any documents back yet. I have not been able to open an account in over 5 years and have n't open any accounts because of this fraudulent error where my identity was used to open the accounts listed above without my consent. Identity theft is one of the biggest crimes and it 's an ongoing crime that i have no control over. During this period i also lost my wallet that had my license, social security card, birth certificate and more. This is been an uncomfortable situation that i had to deal with for a very long time and its affected my life. It 's difficult to work a job and get paid where i can not put my money in the bank because someone used my identity to open several bank accounts under my name.CAPITAL ONE  IS ALLOWING  XXXX  TO BLOCK OUR ACCOUNTS FROM REPORTING.      CAPITAL ONE  REPORTS TO ALL  XXXX  BUREAUS DICOUNT 25 % BALANCE OR BE SUED IN CLASS ACTIONI have been in the process of trying to repair my home for a month now. With current regulations the mortgage company holds all funds from the insurance company to make the repairs. During this process I have been told daily that the funds would be released to my account so that I can pay the contractors. I am now 3 business days past the original date I was told. The company is unresponsive and gives the same answer but offers no solution and will not follow up on their word. Dovenmuehle has been in possession of the insurance check for two weeks now and has yet to release a dime. I have completed all paper work and they have stated that the funds should have been available to me.I have called multiple times and I get the same answer that they will be available tomorrow but it never happens. I am beginning to believe the company is fraudulent and I am being scammed out of $ XXXX in home repairs. I am now paying contractors out of pocket and will be negative in all my accounts causing more headache and fee 's all because this company does not care about the consumer/customer and has taken an excessive amount of time in completing the simplest of tasks. The LOSS DRAFT DEPARTMENT should be investigated.After seeing Debt Recovery Solutions on my credit report I contacted the original creditor because I thought this bill had been paid off already. The original creditor ran my name and social security number it showed a {$0.00} balance. I decided to inform Consumer Finance after completing a over the phone dispute XXXX because the bill is still being reported as open. The bill being reported as open leads me to believe XXXX XXXX XXXX is ignoring the cease and desist I sent them through their own website on XXXX/XXXX/2015 XXXX. I do n't work with collection agencies to settle debts. I had a bill go to collections a few years ago that I paid. The collection agency however never reported the bill as paid, instead they sold it to another collection agency. I showed the proof to the new agency which stopped it 's collection efforts and the original creditor who counted my bill as paid in full luckily for me.I have been denied several times due to a bankruptcy issue that occurred back in XXXX XXXX. This bankruptcy should have been removed off my credit report in XXXX. Trans Union is reporting this information incorrectly. And because of this my credit scores are low too. I was under the understanding that bankruptcy 's should be off the report in 7 years and removed after 10 years. But obviously this is not the case. I should not be suffering any longer on this part of my life that happened over 11 years ago. Please rectify this and get my credit back to where it should be. Thank you.I am submitting this complaint about XXXX credit reporting agency. My first issue is I answered all the security questions to retrieve my report online and was unable to do so. I received a message they can not allow me to view my report at this time. I have an account reporting on my credit report that should be deleted. " XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. I spoke with corporate office in regards to this issue and was told months ago that it was agreed upon it will be deleted off my report. To date it is still reporting on XXXX which is causing me a major problem in obtaining substantial credit as it is affecting my credit score. I have been dealing with this for months now and it still has not been deleted. You are suppose to have 24 hour access to your report online however as I mentioned earlier XXXX will not allow me to view my report. I have contacted legal advise in regards to this issue in suing XXXX because they are not doing a proper investigation. If they did do a proper investigation the response they would receive would to be delete this account off my report. It was deleted off my other credit report. I am very fustrated with XXXX as they do not understand that this is my credit worthiness and it is causing a hardship.Equifax is " updating '' information on my credit report, making it appear more negative and harder for me to obtain credit and productively live my life. I have been recently denied numerous times due to incorrect information on my credit report. I have asked repeatedly for verification of each account and to this date, I have not received any from Equifax. All I get is generic responses of " this item has been verified ''. Equifax has not shown any of the following accounts to be verified and truly owned by me : XXXX, ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX ( sometimes listed as XXXX ), XXXX XXXX ( sometimes listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX ), XXXX/XXXX, and late payments from XXXX XXXX XXXX. These accounts have been removed and readded without my knowledge to my credit report more than a few times and I would like them deleted once and for all to never be readded.At the end of XXXX, XXXX processed the sale of 2 tickets to a music concert. The person who attempted to sell them, my daughter who is a minor, did not have the authority to do so. I immediately contacted XXXX, who reversed the XXXX transfer ( I will attach copies of this transaction ), shut down the account, and informed me that all charges were waived. Recently I received a message from a debt collector, True Accord, attempting to collect this money that was waved in XXXX by a XXXX employee. so disputed this, which they then rejected. Today I contacted XXXX about this. They admit to having a copy of the phone conversation in which these charges were waived. My request for them to review this phone call was denied. I then asked to have a copy of the phone call myself, which they then declined. So, this company has proof that I dont owe them money, wont review it, and also wont share it with me, the person being recorded. I asked to speak with someone higher up, and was denied. I asked to speak to their fraud department, which was also denied. What am I supposed to do here?When I signed for the loan through XXXX said the loan was for 15 years. I needed a cosigner at the time. After repairing my credit I tried to have the co-signer removed only to be denied. My cosigner passed away and I submitted the certificate of death and they have still yet to remove her ( it 's been over a year ) Navient said a law firm XXXX would contact me. No letter has ever come. In this process I found that when XXXX sold my loan to Navient they changed the time period to 21 years. My loan was for XXXX and they did n't apply anything to the principal until just recently. After the loan is paid in full I will have paid XXXX dollars for a XXXX dollar loan. I 'm half way through repayment and my payment is XXXX dollars a month which is on auto debit. It 's more than my car payment. Everytime I have emailed they show no track record of it in the Online inbox and have yet to follow through on the co-signer issue as well as sending me a original copy of the XXXX loan.I had a loan with XXXX XXXX, that I was falling behind on due to a layoff. XXXX sold the loan to XXXX XXXX before it was 120 days late. I had never received the validation letter from XXXX XXXX and when I was in contact with them via phone around XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX they stated they were apart of XXXX and made me believe they were a company within XXXX. ( Like they were an in house collection ). They first asked if I could settle which I could not and said it was fine to just set up small good faith payments, and we would workout a settlement at a later time. I went ahead and set up small good faith payments with no documentation because I thought I was speaking with XXXX XXXX who was already handling my loan. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX and they have reported on my credit file over a year later that this account is in collection with a collection agency. Unbeknownst to me I thought XXXX was apart of XXXX and that this was not with a collections agency and never received any documentation that this was sold to a different company nor have I ever received the Collection Validation letter that you receive when you are sent to a collection agency. Then I also find that XXXX XXXX also sold them my file before I even defaulted which was why I was confused about the debt, and was so willing to continue payments and started payments without question to XXXX XXXX. Both companies were very deceptive in how they conducted business and I also want the debt validated, because what XXXX reported as delinquent and what XXXX shows with the small payments that I have been making do not match. I am afraid at this point they will not honor my validation request because they never sent me the initial validation of debt letter, which is illegal.I am writing in regards to a debt that is listed on my credit report as XX/XX/2017. The information is being reported by IQ Data International ( original creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA ). IQ Data International is reported inaccurate and fraudulent information. Several disputes have been made with all three credit reporting agencies over the past year. The company has not provided proof of the debt. The amount due increases monthly and has resulted in a negative credit rating and financial hardship.Also violating FDCPA by reporting a closed account as " open '' thereby negatively impacting my credit score. Firm refuses to remove inaccurate offending data reporting from my credit file after repeated communications form me demanding same.Wells Fargo failed to honor a settlement offer made to me in XXXX by XXXX XXXX, a rep with Wells Fargo. The offer amount, {$3700.00}, was never received and it is now XXXX. Prior to this, I requested a refund in the amount of {$610.00} which includes mainly overdraft fees charged to accounts not authorized. A total of four mediation request forms were sent in, XXXX XXXX contacted me, offered settlement amount. Since no payment was received in re, additional CFPB complaints were filed. XXXX replied most recently stating numerous attempts at resolution were made, which is a lie and seems to provide the same general form response to each and every complaint. I can assure the CPFB there were no such attempts and Wells Fargo is fully aware of resolution which has been detailed numerous times. I will reiterate again here, refund of {$610.00} will resolve matter since no settlement payment was received. I have contacted the XXXX XXXX City Attorney as per instructions from a XXXX, a rep with class counsel for Wells Fargo Settlement. XXXX informed me Wells Fargo is involved in at least three class actions, XXXX Settlement, WF Settlement, also a settlement with all 50 states and the Attorney General of each state.. I have also contacted Attorney General here in Connecticut as well as California, advised them of my situation. I suspect XXXX will provide the same carbon copy reply in which case I can assure any third party Wells Fargo claims of attempts at resolution are 100 % false and bogus, he has not detailed one such attempt.XXXX   transactions, each for {$75.00} on the same day (  XXXX  ), were posted to my account which I did not make. I called Elan Financial Service on   XXXX   to dispute the sales. I clearly said I did make the charges or know the merchant. Elan did not transfer the handling to their fraud group, but only attempted to get copies of sales.They were then unable to obtain the sales copies, but deem the sales valid and reapplied to my account (  XXXX  ). I then called again (  XXXX  ), this time the representative said both sales would be handling as fraud, closed my account, and sent me new credit cards.In watching my statement, it appeared that they only began handling one of the {$75.00}, as demonstrated by only a single temporary credit.Again, I called to speak with the fraud group (  XXXX  ). This time I was told that the second charge would be handled as fraud and that the " investigator '' would return my call. No call was received.Today (  XXXX  ), I had to call again, as the second {$75.00} is still on the account and I did not received a call as promised after 12-days. This time I was told that the investigator tried to call ( 07/05 ) but could not connect AND they only make one attempt. This is unfair as it requires the customer to ensure follow-up by the bank. I have been promised someone will call me.I need your help, CFPB, in getting Elan Financial and Fidelity Credit Card to do their job and resolve me case.judgment was filed for a credit card debt of XXXX of which XXXX is late charges. Payment could not be made in 2009 when economy tanked and consumer was laid off for 2 years. I have paid {$2100.00} and have the money order receipts for these payments XXXX XXXX dollars for the past 3.4 years. I called to settle this debt and was told it would be based on my current income and XXXX and XXXX wanted to go overall of that on the phone. Barclays charged this account off but is still reporting on my credit. I called Barclays and they can not give me any information because the account was sold. XXXX and XXXX say they do n't report to the credit bureau. I feel like I have paid my dues on this account. We are having lay offs at my company and I want to settle this account as paid with no further payments. I cant get any straight answers. XXXX and XXXX filed a notice of right to have exemptions designated and I completed this to show I had XXXX assets at the time. They still sent the sherriff with a notice demanding payment with court fees attached which appears to have been an unfair and deceptive practice of harassment. I would like to have this judgment released. Enough is enough. I have not missed a payment in 3 yearsI graduated University XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX during this time XXXX kept pressing to take out more loans putting pressure on you in order to graduate. After graduating the job market fell I could only afford so much but XXXX XXXX now know as Navient kept pressing me to put it in forebearance. I had to do that up until XX/XX/XXXX when I finally got a job and I have to keep calling and spending a lot of time on the phone to keep my payments low. They asked for {$180.00} a month so I was paying {$200.00} with my last payment as of XX/XX/XXXX only to receive an email stating that my payment was due. I checked the website and I also called to find out that my payment had been reinstated and that aTotal Payment Due : {$800.00} Current Amount Due : {$500.00} and I have a Past Due Amount : {$290.00}. The customer service rep I talked to said that my 2 year lower payment time was over but I had never received any notifications from them and they always add late fees and if adding up late fees from all the previous times they have done this to me it will add up to over {$2000.00} in late fees when I was never late with one payment. This does not include the fact that they increased the interest rate from 2.65 % to 6.8 % so when I asked about that she stated that is because I could not pay the amount they want for 6 XXXX loans they carry. When I commented on the interest and stated to this rep " So they pretty much just raise the rate when they feel like it because you can not pay the large payment they request every month '' Her answer was yes they do so I think they need to be investigated for this.XX/XX/XXXX and again XX/XX/XXXX I received a Notice of Default on a property that I own in Washington State. No action was taken by Nation Star ( the lien holder ) at that time, just the notices. XX/XX/XXXX I called Nation Star to see if they would consider a deed in lieu and began working with one of their employees named XXXX XXXX. By XX/XX/XXXX it was decided by Nation Star that they would not move forward with the deed in lieu because of site issues with the property. I then started working with the short sale department with Nation Star. I had a buyer and a back up buyer on board at that time. Nation Stars policy regarding short sales, I was told then and just again today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) is to hold an auction. There were XXXX auctions from XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX without a bid on the house. I was told by Nation Star that they would put the house up one more time before XX/XX/XXXX and if no buyer was found then they would proceed with the foreclosure. So my real estate agent and the buyer walked away from the deal. In XXXX of XXXX I was contacted by Nation Star to see if I would consider another short sale agreement and I said that I did n't think that my real estate agent would agree nor the buyer if another auction would be a part of the short sale process again. They told me that since the Notice of Trustee Sale was to be held in XX/XX/XXXX they probably would n't move forward with an auction, so I called my real estate agent and she called the buyer and we began again the short sale process. As of today, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Nation Star wants to proceed with another auction on the property. I had requested in writing that they bypass the auction and either proceed with the short sale or go to foreclosure. I was told that they would consider what they wanted to do and would contact us through their equator program. Have n't heard a word from the equator XXXX XXXX with Nation Star. That request to bypass the auction process was delivered over a week ago.After trying for over a month to resolve this matter, I am writing to you to ask for help. Wells Fargo bank is holding my funds hostage. My daughter recently moved to XXXX to work on her XXXX XXXX degree. We opened a joint account so I could access the funds if she needed anything. She set up online banking so she could transfer between her Wells Fargo account and her bank in XXXX. On XX/XX/2018, Wells Fargo put two trial deposits into the XXXX bank account to verify the account. On XX/XX/2018, using Wells Fargo online banking, I initiated a {$3000.00} transfer from the XXXX bank account to Wells Fargo. The money was debited from the XXXX  bank account on XX/XX/2018 ; but has never been credited to the Wells Fargo bank. For the past month, my daughter and I have on many occasions either visited a branch or called a branch to find out the status of the money. I have been told that since a claim was made by my daughter, that they could not speak with me concerning the case. On XX/XX/2018, I visited a local branch of Wells Fargo to once again try and locate the missing money. After spending over an hour and speaking with three different people via the phone, all I know is that they suspected the transaction was fraudulent and returned the money at XXXX. They still can not say where the money is or when I should be receiving the credit for the deposit. They did tell me to check with the XXXX bank which I have but was told, " since the transaction started on Well Fargo 's website, they would have to resolve this issue. ''Nationstar Mortgage, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX XXXX This month, XXXX 2016 this company started requiring social security number to be entered when logging in to make online payments.

Please note that when I tried to change my password and security question answers earlier this year the web site crashed and would not allow these changes. I contacted them several times and was able to change the password once but never the security question answers. It appears that the programmers for Nationstar lack the extensive knowledge to build a secure site. I contacted customer service at the number above and got the standard excuses as to why they must have the SSN and that the web site could not be changed back. Again the demand for the SSN at login is a demand implemented within the past 30 days and so it can be changed.I stop attending classes because I had personal issues during the yearXX/XX/XXXX,  since then I stopped assisting to my classes, and they continued to charge me until now the date XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2013On XX/XX/2018 I received an email solicitation from Chase with a promotional offer to file my taxes using XXXX XXXX website. In the advertisement it advised me that being a chase customer I was entitled to XXXX $ fed and XXXX $ state filing, all I had to do was click the emedded hyper-link. As I typically used tax act and paid XXXX-XXXX $ to file I decided to take them up on the offer. After the completion of filing I was advised I owed XXXX XXXX {$80.00}, I carefully read the original email to see if there was a promotional code to be entered, however there was not. After spending a great deal of time preparing my filing I decided to pay the fee and then call Chase customer service the next day. When I called chase I spent nearly 40 minutes on the phone only to be told, # 1 I shouldn't be getting the email in question because I am not in their " targeted zone '' # 2 if I wanted to see any reimbursement or resolution I needed to prepare all my documents and manually mail them to an address in XXXX, DE. I then told the customer service rep that I feel my only recourse is to take this occurrence to the CFPB she offered to refund me 6 months of interest in a statement credit as a compromise. As I figured that would take my total out of pocket expense to {$40.00} XXXX  {$50.00} I felt that was fair. Now over 2 weeks later that credit never appeared and that is why I am filing the complaint.XX/XX/2019I just received a request from DISCOVER Credit Card Service asking me to sign Document 4506-T. I appears to me, by signing this document, DISCOVER will then have access to my IRS tax returns and any other info IRS may have on me. DISCOVER did not require me to sign such a document when they extended me credit years ago so I don't see why they feel they are entitled to it today. I have been doing business with them for years and ALWAYS pay my bill on-time and in full. They told me if I don't sign, they will cancel my accounts. They have already froze my account so I can't even see my recent transactions or where I stand financially with them.

I received an email that my account is canceled. Called to follow up the young lady XXXX who does not work in headquarters she is currently located in XXXX -states the credit bureau made the decision. Then corrected herself by saying you missed payments .... Which I then explained I have had an issue with the green card because I was misinformed, I was unable to pay total balance, but I am making payments!! I asked for her title to ensure she was a supervisor, which she is not! I also would like to speak with headquarters for action but unable to. I explained that American express is breaking the law, we are currently in different countries, I have not received a far chance to correct my balance!! I still have a payment agreement set up!!First, I should not be charged the late fee, as I didnt know what I had to pay, since I had filed previous complaints with the CFPB and was waiting for them to be resolved.Please refund late fee and interest charged.On the the interest, I logged on recently and noticed my rate is now 29 % ( apr I believe ). I think if anything, and according to the Obama Credit Card reform act, my rate, after paying more than the first six months off on time ( Im almost positive if not more than six ) should have gone down. I havent kept track so much but I doubt I had started with 29 % rate. So to sum up, please lower the rate based on the law I mention, and refund the interest and late fees. For XX/XX/XXXX for example, I was given a refund of both but never had a chance or knew what I should pay before Capital One considered it late.My credit card was charged by the vendor XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$11000.00} for the purchase of an aquamarine center stone and diamond ring. The ring was advertised and valued at {$68000.00}. After engaging a reputable local appraiser, I discovered the ring was falsely advertised as an aquamarine and dimanond ring. It was in fact a topaz and diamond ring of a much lesser value ( approx. {$7900.00} ).  I engaged the seller who recognized the mistake, took the ring back and acknowledged to refund me the {$11000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. As of today I did not received the refund. I opened a dispute with citicard on XX/XX/XXXX and provided very detailed documentation of the purchase ( 28 pages in total ), appraisals of the ring, confirmation of the return of the ring to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and email traffic between me and the seller, who acknowledged receiving the ring and to refund me the {$11000.00}. I called and chatted with the citicard dispute office in 3 occasions just to make sure they had everything they needed. The answer was always yes and that they would come back to me with a resolution. On XX/XX/XXXX, without any previous notice, I received an email from citicard that 2 of the 28 pages I've sent them were not readable and declined my dispute. The {$11000.00} were back on my credit card. I called citicard dispute office to verify my next step and after receiving instructions I resubmitted all the documentation again with a " more readable '' version of the two pages they were questioning about. I called and talked to two dispute specialists again who ensured me that all the pages now were readable and that another specialist would get back to me in a few days. The people I've interacted with so far don't seem to even read my emails or the documentation I've provided. One of them even told me that my documentation never made it to the seller financial institution. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX nobody at citicard even looked at the details of my dispute. This should be an easier resolution considering I've returned the ring to the seller and I've the message from the seller acknowledging the ring was not a center stone aquamarine but a center stone topaz ring of a much lesser value. I even have provided the message from the seller who agrees to refund the {$11000.00}. I'm not confident in the ability of citicard to handle this issue properly. I've been a valued customer for more than 15 years and in those 15 years only two disputes for less than {$40.00}. I was not expecting such poor customer service. For additional clarification about this issue, see details below of the opening statement I've provided to Citicard ( additional documentation to support my claim can be provided as needed ) : I've purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX, owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a ring that was sold and advertised as an aquamarine and diamond ring valued at {$68000.00} ( I have the XXXX   appraisal report that XXXX provided as documentation ). The ring was sold to me at {$11000.00}. When I received the ring, I had the impression that the center stone was a lot darker than the pictures XXXX XXXX send me and I decided to engage a reputable and certified XXXX appraiser to validate the authenticity of the ring ( XXXX appraisers are the only recognized appraiser service in the country ). When I initially purchase the ring the seller told me that the ring was coming with a XXXX appraisal, not an XXXX appraisal which is the one they  provided. I got nervous and decided to engage a local reputable appraiser. My appraiser documented that the ring was not an aquamarine, but a topaz of a much lesser value and some of the diamonds were questionable. His suggestion was to return the ring because he didnt think this was a reputable seller.The value of the ring based on my private appraisal was approximately {$7900.00} and assumed the diamonds were real, which he doubted strongly but some of them were so small he could not tell. After this discovery, I tried to contact the seller without success. The phone number was disconnected. I was able to reach by phone the XXXX appraiser the seller has engaged, who was shocked to hear what happened and ensured me the ring he has appraised was an aquamarine. He also told me he would contact the owner of XXXX XXXX and would make sure he would call me back. When I was finally able to talk to XXXX XXXX ( the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) via phone, he said the ring was authentic and ensured me that my appraiser was mistaken. To prove my appraiser wrong, he agreed to do a XXXX appraisal himself, free of charge for me, just to show me that his XXXX appraisal he originally sent was accurate. He also agreed to refund the full {$11000.00} if the ring was in fact a topaz of much lesser value ( I have documentation of this ). I then sent the ring back and was received by XXXX XXXX it on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX report came back to XXXX XXXX and I got confirmation from him that my appraiser was right : the center stone was in fact a topaz and not an aquamarine. I asked for XXXX XXXX to honor his commitment to refund me the full amount of {$11000.00}. He was apologetic and said he would issue a credit immediately. Since then, not only XXXX XXXX has not returned my messages and calls, but the credit has not been issued, as hes committed to do. Not only he's the ring, but he has my money.Capitol One Auto has placed 5-30 day late marks and 2-60 day late marks. There should only be 2-30 day late marks and zero 60-day.

Experian deleted a few months ago and now reappearing. A representative claimed they weren't ever removed, which is false as I attached a copy of the credit report to support that the accounts had been deleted, now reappering. I spoke to someone name XXXX XXXX XXXX who indicated that that the accounts were never deleted and claims they were verified which is a way to cover up them putting them back on my credit report. I received an alert from an outside organization that there was a change to my Experian credit file two months later and I was mortified to see that the old collection accounts had been placed back on my credit file. The alert by my bank is how I discovered the 16 accounts were reinserted on my credit and when I disputed, within a day I received an email stating the dispute was finalized and it is impossible to complete an accurate investigation for a dispute in a day or so. I do not know this creditor XXXX but this collection agency is falsifying opening dates/payment history because I have not had any accounts opened in over 10 years and they have an opening date of XX/XX/2016, The company falsified information saying the account was opened in XX/XX/2016. I am attaching the credit report to show the creditor was not on my credit file then it reappears. I have attached verification requests letters that have been submitted to Experian and disregarded.I have no idea who AFNI INC is or who they represent.

I never opened an account with them or anybody else. This account must be a result of identity theft or someone opening an account in my name using my identity. I have no knowledge of this account nor did I give anyone permission to open an account with my name.

At that point she called me and told me I needed to get to her house and talk to this woman, at which point I did. She told me that she had been contacted and had this matter turned over to her, funny thing is this is the same company that I talked to before. Incidentally she had told the whole story about this to my girlfriend and stated they would have me arrested if I did n't resolve it today. I talked to her on my girlfriends phone ( XXXX ) for approximately XXXX minutes, she told that I could be arrested because I had sent a check, which I never did and had created fraud against this Payday loan Company ( XXXX ), I basically was forced to sign a document under duress that I would make this matter be paid from my debit card, as they would no longer accept any checks from me.

However, she had left a voicemail and ever since then we have been playing phone tag. She also has n't paid attention to my request that I left in my voicemails. Because of my work schedule and the time zone difference, I had requested that she call me before XXXX. To me, that 's a small thing to ask. After each voicemail I left her, I ended up having to repeat myself as to what times would be best to contact me, and I had to leave a voicemail quickly as I was using my break time to respond to her. In my 2nd voicemail I left her I requested if we could communicate through email and I even provided her my email address. She responded to my email with a generic, robot-like response, only repeating what her office hours were and not at all like there was a human on the other end of that email. I have since again, left her a 3rd voicemail!, requesting her to either let me know if she could take care of my request which is to have my online account closed! That 's all I 'm asking for!

Thank you very much for your time!!!I previously contacted all XXXX credit reporting bureaus in early 2014 after completing a rehab of my student loans. I just learned yesterday in the process of buying a house and after a XXXX bureau credit pull that Equifax is still reporting a XXXX account as a collection account. I contacted XXXX, and they say I have to dispute with the reporting agency. My frustration is two-fold : 1. I already did this and it worked as the process was supposed to with all other issues and with the other 2 reporting bureaus. Now I have to wait between XXXX days for my credit report to show this ; and 2. I 'm not going to be able to close on my home loan on time because of this, and I 'm going to have to scramble to make alternative living arrangements and expenses, and may see the seller pull out of the deal leaving me to also try and find a new place to live permanently!In the   XXXX   of    1998  I graduated from  XXXX  my loan total was about {$6000.00}. I have made years of payments to  XXXX   XXXX  and then years of payments to Navient and yet my balance is over {$6000.00}. I have contacted both companies and no one can tell me what is going on, it has been almost 20 years and my balance is still the same. This is my first step before I try and contact attorneys involved in lawsuits against them. For years I was making payments of {$120.00} a month but as it has been 20 years i now longer have these records.The public record in question has been reporting with an incorrect filing date. The judgement was paid in full when I was surprised with a document via Certified Mail. I contacted the collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ) immediately and they told me the debt was from a hospital. I had been getting the run around from the hospital and my insurance company about this debt and then it got kicked to the collection agency. I would like to state that I paid off the judgement in full immediately after receiving the documents. The dates differ from each collection agency to the next as far as the filing date of XXXX/XXXX/10 to XXXX/XXXX/10 for the civil judgment. The dates simply do n't match up. It 's also frustrating when the original debt from the hospital was from years before that. This needs to be removed. This whole ordeal was a messy and heart-wrenching one for me years ago. I had a health problem so I went to get healthcare and the insurance and hospital billing were n't seeing eye to eye and I was n't being kept in loop. It gets sent to collections and I get a surprise judgment against me and I had to scramble to pay it in full. Anyways, that 's my personal story. I 've grown wiser. The whole deal was a fly by the pants operation and it gets reported wrong to the collection agencies. Thank you for reading this. I do appreciate it.I am XXXX for the XXXX and since the market crashed, I took a pay cut. Based on that, I had to modify my loan ( Mortgage ) so that I could afford my monthly mortgage.

This has affected me because its stopping me from refinancing my loan so that I can have a more affordable payment and provide for my family.My friend in AZ is selling her home and shopping for a new loan.

Any written agreements between myself and the original creditor stating this debt is owed 4. Full account summary and itemized calculation of alleged debt 5. Date of the first delinquency 6. Dates and times of any phone calls made and to what number in an attempt to contact me concerning the alleged debt before it was reported to an agency, and so proving that these calls were made in the times governed by FDCPA law. If XXXX XXXX XXXX is unable to provide the above identifying account information, this account must be deleted from both credit reporting agencies. This account is affecting negatively on both credit reporting agencies. I have already notified all 3 credit bureaus regarding this issue. The agency insufficiently met it's statutory burden pursuant to FDCA because ( 1 ) the agency did not provide the account 's date of first delinquency, nor ( 2 ) provide me the account 's the date of last activity. I have not now, nor ever had any contractual obligation or arrangement with XXXX XXXX XXXX.I have written directly to each of the credit-reporting agencies multiple times since XXXX XXXX when I realized there were problems with items they were reporting. All answered me but did not remove the inaccurate items and my credit score has been dramatically decreased ... from over XXXX to now under XXXX despite only XXXX even possible negative item which I have disputed with the company to no avail. *I have never had a bankruptcy or foreclosure. *I have no personal or business loans at all - no car loan, no student loan. *I have approximately {$31000.00} balance on a mortgage that has never missed a payment in 25+ years. *Of the credit that I have actively available, I use well less than XXXX, more like XXXX % in revolving credit on XXXX credit cards ( XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX ) that is paid every month without fail. **There was an XXXX XXXX dispute that was resolved in my favor, which the credit bureaus are aware of, but somehow the " delinquency '' continues - is that right, even when the balance is XXXX? **There was a XXXX dispute from XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX where I tried to return a faulty cell phone and XXXX would neither allow me to return it for a new XXXX or fix the problem. So I cancelled the service. Only XX/XX/XXXX did that show up as a " collection '' item. **There is an XXXX XXXX item listed as delinquent on an old savings account that never had any credit associated with it. It dates from XX/XX/XXXX, it never existed, the XXXX branch is long gone from my neighborhood and yet they refuse to remove it. How can I have a credit score under XXXX based on XXXX " possible '' but strongly disputed problem valued at {$300.00}? It feels like I am being held hostage to some outrageous unknown extortionist. Please help. XXXXOn Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by a CS agent from Mr. Cooper. The person called told me her name was XXXX calling out of XXXX, the exchange starting with XXXX- She express congratulations on our mortgage modifications. Please note the only way to complete the modification according to Mr.Cooper/Nations Star besides complete the trial payments was to pay XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX ( which we did with two separate payments ) one cashier 's check, the other personal check which was cashed/cleared. Both payments were sent via XXXX. Although the person called to express congratulations on the modification she said she was calling to ask if we were behind on any Home Owner Association dues. I gave her the information, Then she told me she was calling about our XX/XX/XXXX payment. I nearly loss it, because these were already sent and we are attempting to move forward. First she stated she could not find any payments we made, then she said she did find it and stated we owed more. After about 15 minutes, she said there is {$110.00} missing and she would put in a request to see what happened to {$110.00}, but she found the two payments. Then she said she could take a payment for XXXX, so I gave her our bank information. The next day I called the number she gave me and said it was her direct line. I called the number and the number was Mr. Cooper but not assign to anyone. Additionally when I called back and spoke to another person she said WE OWED FOR XXXXXXXX,  at this point I hate we have gotten into this type of mortgage with such confusing transactions and inexperienced customer service people who may not have the proper knowledge and abilities when speaking to homeowners on mortgage payments, escrow, taxes and basic customer service. I ended the call and called someone else who again claimed we owed for XX/XX/XXXX. I move the money from my bank account that would have paid XXXX XXXX mortgage because I was told it was for XXXX when I know it should be for XX/XX/XXXX. Afterwards I received repeating emails that our mortgage payment was received numerous times. These are unlimited indications this mortgage company is disconnected and does not know what CS agents are doing in XXXX  versus what those in XXXX are doing ... .several agents swore they knew what they were doing although they could not find the payments I spoke of that was for XXXX and XXXX. I received a letter about a surplus in escrow but would go toward past due payments if the account was not in good standing, the agent told me there was not a surplus because XX/XX/XXXX was not received. These are the types of experiences which makes excuses for them unacceptable. There is still a fact of the XXXX  male called to harass me that I better take the modification then said I decline and the modification was rejected. Even after the recent called congratulating us on the modification, those that I have spoke to within the last two days mentioned the modification was rejected. The person reading this for CFPB it is my hope that you will give further instructions for consumers when mortgage companies like this exist!!!!!!There was fraudulent activity committed on my account on Wed., XX/XX/2019. I was not notified by my bank whatsoever. I noticed me being locked out of my online banking app and I called the 1800 number that night when I got home from work in regards to me being locked out. They proceeded to tell me that there was a hold on my account due to fraudulent activity. The operator told me to go to my branch the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and take my ID to get things resolved. I went the following morning to the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, IL. The banker told me that they were going to close my account due to my account putting their bank at risk for fraud. She asked me did I issue my login info to anyone and I told her that I did not. She proceeded to tell me that their would be a hold on my account to where I can not withdraw money but deposits are still able to be made. I told her that my work check would be deposited on the next day, Friday, XX/XX/XXXX. I called my job and they said they had already deposited the money that morning ( Thursday the XXXX ) and that the only way they could give me a paper check was if the bank rejected the deposit. I asked the banker could they put a hold on it for deposits to be rejected as well, she told me no. The next day, which was Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I called the branch to speak with a manager about me being able to take my deposit out of the bank during this investigation. I was informed there was a double hold on my account now that was put into place that morning. My direct deposit has already hit my account at this point. The bank waited to collect my direct deposit before placing that deposit hold on my account. I talked to the assistant manager who was very rude and disrespectful. She told me I had the option to pay the negative amount in my savings account to make it {$0.00} and then the hold would be lifted and I could withdraw my funds from the checking account. I didnt understand that. The asst. manager told em over the phone that she did not have time for attitude and that was the only option I had. I asked her for her name which she failed to give me and refused to give me. She told me if i paid the money that maybe, well see about giving me the money in my checking. I told her I would call the XXXX XXXX XXXX and let them know how rude and unprofessional they were. She proceeded to call me a fraud and tell me good luck with letting the XXXX know that I am a fraud and committed fraud on my own account. She then hung up on me. So on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to her specific branch to try and gather and understanding as to how Im responsible for them giving money for a check through my online mobile banking app without my proper signature on it, and also Ive never had that much money in my account ever. They didnt call and verify this online check with me. They made {$200.00} available and the hacker withdrew that {$200.00} instantly through the atm. I should not be responsible for this {$200.00} because they failed to protect me through verifications. Now they are holding my money in my checking account.Navient confirmed loan, however did not address statue of LimitationsI called mcm and told them it's a case of I'd theft and disputed but no validation received till now ...I have a compliant dealing with addresses that do not belong on my credit report.

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I attempted to contact the Federal Loan department of Navient, and after getting their automated system to understand that I need to talk to a real person I was transferred to another automated message saying that their offices were closed. This runs counter to their " contact us '' information provided online as well as in the automated message that I was transferred to, with both sources of information saying their Federal Loan department was open till XXXX on Fridays. After this I attempted to call another number, and got through to the Private Loan office.

However, my student loan has been in forbearance since XXXX 2015 due to the lawsuit against XXXX University. I filed a " Borrower Defense to Repayment '' and was confirmed that my loans were and still are in forbearance for a couple of years now. I tried fixing this situation but they still reporting negative. They are reporting two loans both as 90 days late and this information needs to be corrected. XXXX has failed to remove those 3 late payments from my credit report, knowing that the information being reported is invalid and I 've disputed it on my credit report once before. My student loan account needs to be updated to reflect no late payments.This dispute is in regards to a collection on my report from XXXX that should have been deleted from my credit reports. The had a collection placed on my report for a XXXX bill at a location I never lived at nor had service.

I do feel that this is my deceased fathers debt, as we have the same name.On XXXX XXXX we did a wire transfer to a beneficiary we 've known for a long time, using the wire transfer services from Bank of America. This was not the first time we wired the same company. We have for many times sent money from the SAME ACCOUNT and TO THE SAME ADDRESSEE. And at all times except this XXXX our supplier got the money with no major issues. This time the money was NEVER received and Bank of America says that there is nothing they can do if the other part did not get the money. They suggest me to contact the intermediary bank! HOw come? Is with Bank of America I deal with! This is at Bank of America I deposit our money and " trust ''. How come they CAN NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE for a wire transfer service if they charge to do it??? This is the information on the XXXX : XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX, XXXXAccount Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Number for XXXX XXXX Number I received XXXX from Customer Service @ Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - Ext XXXX email is XXXXXXXXXXXX and my ph number is XXXXOn XX/XX/XXXX, I received an annual escrow account disclosure statement dated XX/XX/XXXX from Lakeview Loan Servicing , LLC. This statement reflected a {$1900.00} shortfall in the escrow account associated with my mortgage, & the mortgage payment was set to increase 27 % from {$660.00} to {$830.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Property taxes are only {$370.00} per year, & XXXX property hazard insurance was {$2000.00}. {$250.00} of each mortgage payment was being deposited into escrow throughout XXXX, which should have easily covered these amounts for the year. However, after calling Lakeview Loan Servicing 's customer support line ( XXXX ) 3 different times on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, & being placed on hold for over 45 minutes each & every time, Agent #  XXXX ( XXXX ) finally admitted that escrow funds had been misapplied between my escrow account & someone else 's account in early XXXX. After the loan company " fixed '' their mistake, somehow my escrow account is now nearly {$2000.00} short. They now need to make up the difference over the course of 12 months by raising my overall mortgage payment to a level that is completely beyond my current budget, as my wife has recently become employed again after a long period of unemployment. Although XXXX clearly admitted on a recorded line that the escrow mistake was made on their ( Lakeview Loan Servicing ) end of things, I am still left with them expecting payments exceeding {$800.00} per month beginning XX/XX/XXXX. If I could fire this mortgage company, I would. Apparently raising my mortgage payment by nearly {$200.00} is the only option available to me, even though the mistake was on their end & I have done nothing wrong. I have been offered no other options or detailed explanation, or even an apology for getting my escrow account so out of sorts to begin with. Unfortunately, my plan of action at this point is to pay my normally budgeted mortgage payment of {$660.00} in XXXX, because it is all that I can do. I am sure that the late fees will start piling up, & if it goes on like that long enough, I will end up losing my house over a " fixed '' mistake that this horrible loan company made with my escrow account. This has ultimately turned my American dream of home ownership into a real nightmare, & if there is any way for other homeowners to avoid this company, PLEASE DO SO!My name is XXXX XXXX and I have been a loyal customer with PNC for the past several years I have both personal and business accounts with them including vredit cards and lines of credit. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed several transactions in my checking account from pay for donations to an individual in the XXXX. This individual somehow was able to comprimise my XXXX account and send multiple donation to himself over the course of 3 months for almost $ 11k. I immediately noticed PNC bank of this and the closed down my card and began an investigation. However in less than 2 weeks XXXX presented the sellers side of the story which was : showing screen shots of the money being received and someone posing as me without mt name or email address. Thank him for absolutely nothing. I have been a member with XXXX sine XXXX. And this is the worst think they couldve done to me. My bank has claimed sine they can not raise the issue with XXXX, i need to get my money back ASAP. And look forward to your help. XXXX, XXXXOn XX/XX/XXXX I leased a car through Nissan. XX/XX/XXXX my car was stolen and involved in accident. When I called my insurance I was informed that I only had liability and the car was n't fully covered. When getting the car the salesman told me that he called my insurance company to verify my insurance and told me I was good to go. I have a paper where he said he called, but my insurance has no record of him calling. The finance manager then went on to fill out the lease agreement as if I was fully covered and signed the contract. I feel I was mislead and lied to. By North Carolina state requirements the dealership is required to call to verify the purchasers insurance. If in fact he did call then this would n't be an issue. The General Manager told me that they do not have to check customers insurance and that if you show them an insurance card that they assume you are fully covered ( I find that hard to believe ).I sent a letter and have yet to receive a response. Unfortunately, I was the victim of identity theft. I have done everything required of me by law to dispute the fraudulent items on my credit report. I sent a letter to " ALLY FINANCIAL '' on XX/XX/2014 via USPS certified mail. The company refuses to honor my rights under the FDCPA & the FCRA as a victim of identity theft to remove the fraudulent inquiry that was submitted without my knowledge, consent and/or authorization. Please find attached the notice that was sent out along with the attached certified receipt. Information can be tracked online using referenced information. Thank you for you time and attention regarding the matter.I have about {$90000.00} just in private student loans. I have XXXX private loans with different interests rates which is about {$900.00} a month just for my private loans. I have federal loans with Navient as well and those are about {$300.00} a month with a total of about {$1200.00} a month just for student loans. I have let Navient know multiple times that I am not able to afford that amount of money a month and they refuse to work with me to lower my payments. They have insisted that I am at the lowest payments. They have suggested that I put my loans in forbearance and did not let me know that I only have a certain amount of times for my loans to be put in forbearance and that when they put it in forbearance they tell you it 's for 3 months, but do n't tell you that they will back date your account that three months so it really only ends up being 1 month of no payment. My private loans have lowered my credit score by XXXX points. As of right now they put me on a 15 month payment plan and they say that after 3 months my account will be " current '' and my credit score will go up. I only agreed because I am concerned about my credit score and they refused to lower my payments without me being on a payment plan. These loans have been very stressful since I 've graduated. I am not able to consolidate my private loans and when my federal loans were consolidated they split it up into XXXX lump sum loans instead of one loan. With my credit score being lowered due to this that will hinder me from purchasing a home, car or anything else. Student loans and Navient have ruined my life.I requested spot loan to draft the full payment via e-mail below : Post the full balance for payment ...

It has my credit score slightly down. I want this corrected immediately. It is registered with a XXXX balance and showing a foreclosure. You can't have a foreclosure and XXXX balance. I also can not have two1st mortgages at the same time. I also have spoke to this mortgage company and they have agreed it is inaccurate and stated it would better if XXXX and the credit. Bureaus correct their information. This information should be expedited on my report as soon as possible. I would this complete by tomorrow, I have waited too long for this process. I can be reached at XXXX XXXX XXXXAS Astra sent documentation affirming debt of XXXX however failed. ( 1 ) They failed to validate acquisition price paid and incurred expenses ( my new liability to AD Astra as a debt buyer ) to justify continued collection attempts. This is my right. Otherwise, ( 2 ) this is an active attempt to collect usurious interest as defined by the RICO statue by pursuing of collection posted to all my credit reports impacting my credit score ( 3 ) and Failing to consistently report the same data to all bureaus, date of debt varies as reported to 2 agencies. My new liability is estimated to be less than 50.00. Unreportable in this circumstance.I previously filed a complaint XXXX. The company replied on XX/XX/2018. They attached a letter verifying the debt. They attached statements. The statements show my address yet the address is missing my apartment number, I live in a building therefore this seems to be a fraud account opened without my authorization.XXXX XXXX has said TWICE now they have " run my credit '' for a credit card application. I have verified via my report they have not pulled my actual information. They have returned twice now I am not found, no credit history. Etc. They did not even respond to my first CFPB complaint and just found out yesterday they " closed my case '' without speaking to me. They clearly are performing serious fraudulent activities and will not even speak with me about what has happened. I was attacked on the phone and screamed at by a " XXXX '' whose only point was to tell me we had never spoken before. We didn't speak any further occasions either. Nor did any other members of this so called bank follow up. They just closed the issue with zero resolution.This appears to be from a charged-off credit card BANK ONE, I do NOT recognize. The Charge-off date appears XX/XX/XXXX. No Complaint ever filed. No payment by me was made on this account. Starting XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Collection Letter from a MA attorney. My attorney mailed a letter to this attorney, requesting a copy of any Judgment for this issue. We never received a reply. Letters continued to arrive from this Collection Attorney. Finally, they seemed to cease. XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX- I receive another Collection Notice, for same original account, from a different Collection/Debt Buyer. XXXX XXXX XXXX. My attorney mailed a 'Cease & Desist '' letter, via USPS Certified Mail. After this letter, my attorney received a call from the law firm for this Collection Co. Calls back and forth went on for about one month. I was told these notices would cease. XX/XX/XXXX- I received another Collection Notice for the same account, from a different Collection/Debt Buyer, Dynamic Recovery Solutions and Accelerated Financial Solutions. My attorney mailed the same " Cease & Desist '' letter to these new Collectors, via Certified USPS. I counted XXXX Collection/Debt Buyers on this account since it states it Charged-off. My attorney filed a complaint against XXXX, for allowing the account to continue, and against Dynamic ( DRS ) and XXXX ( XXXX ) for not checking any status on this account before proceeding. In documents with these companies, my complete SS # is reflected. There is n't any redaction. I am really scared this will continue. Is there a limit on how often a debt can be bought and sold over time? This could go on for infinity, and the Debt Buyers/Collection Agencies do not seem concerned. I do n't have any assurance my personal information is safe. Help!Entered into a car title loan with Wilshire consumer credit. At one point I knew I would fall behind on payments before the payment was late I contacted Wilshire Consumer to ask for a payment arrangement or deferment. The said XXXX no this is a car tile loan and we can repo your car after XXXX day late. I called back a couple of days later explained I could not make the payment and they said that I should have called before I was late to make arrangements. I told them I did. The employee was so rude, threatened to repossess the car, called me ignorant and was actually yelling and talking over me. Days later they repossessed my car. They made me pay about {$1000.00} to get it back and I got it back. Before I made the payments to get the car back I asked them if they would be able to defer my next payment so I could catch up. They agreed and send me an extension agreement stating that my next payment was due XXXX XXXX. The contract was signed by myself and by Wilshire. When I called them to confirm the deferment they said that they messed up on the paperwork and that my actual payment is due XXXX XXXX intead of XXXX. I told them that that 's not what the agreement says. Now they are calling harassing me, threatening to repo my car again and they will never let me speak to a supervisor. They call me a loser, Scream and yell, hang up and lie about the supervisors. The few times I have spoken to a supervisor they contradict what the employees say. I have paid them over {$3000.00} and I only borrowed {$2500.00}. They are constantly calling threatening me and say that my extension was not approved. I have documentation showing the agreement.This experience with my car loan it 's been horrible. It was my first time buying and they absolutely took advantage of me. Even with a good credit my interest rate it 's 18 %. My monthly payments are XXXX and almost {$170.00} of that goes to the interest. At this pace I 'd never be able to pay off this loan and eventually I 'll have to surrender the car. On XXXX I called Westlake Financial and asked them to help make a payment towards the principal. The phone call was recorded so there 's proof to that, I asked the agent named XXXX to make a XXXX time payment of {$600.00} towards the principal, next thing I know & XXXX of that was taken towards interest. I specifically asked the agent if he could assure me that everything was going to go towards the principal and he said yes. So how it 's possible for this to happen when I was so specific about this payment? Their Customer Service Representatives are rude and unwilling to help.Around XXXX of 2017, I lost my wallet and my personal information was used fraudulently. I received notification from many sources such as my personal bank and other cards that my credit cards and other information was being used with out my knowledge. Upon this notification, I immediately contacted my creditors and banks and made them aware. Most creditors canceled the card and issued me a new one. On XX/XX/2017, I notified XXXX/XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Card XXXX about this issue and I closed the account at consumer 's request. They then sent me a statement with the fraudulent charges to pay. This account is currently still on my credit reports as a charged off account as I refused to pay for fraudulent charges. I have disputed this account with all 3 bureaus, sent documentation to include a police report and only XXXX has deleted the incorrect account. XXXX and Equifax continue to report account is verified and validated. When I asked for proof of validation, XXXX XXXX XXXX sent copies of the charges. This is not an acceptable source of validation! These charges were not by me nor were they authorized. This is a violation of my Federal rights as my credit history is being tarnished by erroneous and inaccurate information that is to be deleted from my credit file and the creditor has not validated the debt.Called my child 's telephone and said they were the XXXX County Sheriff and wanted to issue a summons for me on bank XXXX, I also received this same message left on my phone. They then called my employer and left this message for my boss. I called the sheriffs department and they did not call me.I want my tcf bank to allow XXXX XXXX to see how much money I have and for them to do partner upI submitted a complaint to the NH XXXX DOJ they have tried to help me with XXXX XXXX but was unsuccessful. They suggested I send my complaint to CFPB All of my mortgage payments have been made for the 13 years I have had my mortgage. I have never missed a payment. XXXX XXXX is reporting to the credit bureaus that I have Missed Payments XXXX XXXX admits they would not accept payments during a review process for a loan Modification which spanned over 5 months. How is it okay for them to not accept my payments and to continue to charge me late fees, report missed payments and report late payments. I am believe this to be fraudulent, predatory and unethical. I further believe it is in direct violation of the FCRA. XXXX XXXX worked on our modification for 5 months then denied our request for assistance. During that 5 months I initiated communication with them on almost every occasion. On many occasions the application was stalled in one department or another until I initiated contact urging them to move the application along. After 5 months the application was denied because it was deemed our income was too high to qualify for the program, a program which they recommended to us. XXXX XXXX had our income amounts on the first day we submitted the application. Because the process took so long the late fees piled up and the fraudulent credit report continued. XXXX XXXX at inception claimed the process could take as little as 10 days, in our case it was over 140 days. This is a case of a fraudulent Bait and Switch tactic. XXXX XXXX reports to the credit bureaus that my payments for XX/XX/2018 to XX/XX/2018 are 120-149 days late these payments were paid in a lump sum in early XXXX the reporting is fraudulent In summary I feel we have been victim of predatory lending, charged illegal fees and are victims of fraudulent reporting to the credit bureaus. These violations are well within your purview. I urge you to request our file from XXXX XXXX, it will show that we pleaded with them to expedite the modification process. Ask XXXX XXXX for the phone transcripts, they will show that they repeatedly lied to us and assured on many occasions that the process would be completed by a certain date which came and went until we again initiated contact. Ask for the original loan documents they refer to, that they allege allows them to not accept payments yet charge late fees and report fraudulently to the credit bureaus. Furthermore, recognize that XXXX XXXX is being sued on a regular basis for its unethically and illegal practices we are another one of their victims. Dont allow them to send you a canned response form letter like they did to the State oh NH DOJ. Because of their fraudulent reporting we have recently denied credit 3 times, stuck with them because due to their reporting we are unable to get our loan moved to another lender. Lastly, XXXX XXXX offered us a program allegedly to help people in need with unique circumstances after you review our application you be the judge if we fit that criterion, I am confident you will agree we should have been immediately approved or maybe this is yet another predatory program XXXX XXXX is pushing or faking! I realize you cant force an organization to have empathy but I refuse to be taken advantage of! I hope you will agree with me and take this matter further I have appealed to XXXX XXXX senior management and I get the same canned responses.TD Bank/ Target XXXX should be reporting a ZERO balance.

The company website needed my last name and last six digits of my social security number.

They send letters and call me. They updated the debt on my credit report so it renewed a couple of times and would not leave my credit report.

On X/XX/17 I received a response that XXXX XXXX had provided verification this information was correct. Prior to me sending a letter to XXXX, Transunion and XXXX, I froze my account with XXXX XXXX and have a letter verifying this was done, so there would not have been a way for XXXX, Transunion or XXXX to 'verify ' this information.

They keep asking for a " XXXX '' or " XXXX '' or whoever. They have called SO many times and been SO very abusive that I would honestly like to persue criminal charges and even civil too. The abuse is UNBELIEVABLE! The two odd things are : 1 ) they have TWO of our phone numbers in the same house, asking for the same person ... both of us have explained SEVERAL times we do NOT know her! We have NO debt with them! They get VERY rude and call over and over. I told them I would report to FTC, FCC, here and State Attorney General 's Office, but they laugh and hang up. Guess what? 10 minutes later his phone rings. 30 minutes later, my phone rings. This is not only bad business practice, but this is directly harassment! They will not identify themselves beyond that " company name '', and refuse to remove our numbers. I do not know how calling over and over will help get some XXXX here. PLEASE! HELP US MAKE THEM STOP! Here is the phone number, the same number every time that they call from is : XXXX.

They reported a repossession on my credit even though the account shows as current in their system. I never missed a payment. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX do not return calls and they do not give emails. My credit report has shown an incorrect repossession for more than 5 months. This is the worst customer service I ever witnessed in my entire life. Seems like the bank is participating in a conspiracy to intentionally destroy peoples lives.I believe PayPal is a fraud. They do not have accurate reporting on their web site. They they slap you with huge finance charges even when the web site says nothing is due. They blame it on the fact that there are XXXX companies XXXX and PayPal Credit but it is XXXX company. They do not allow any grace period One day nothing is due on their wb site and the next day you are overdue. If you pay that same day by XXXX they say there is no grace period. That is against the rules of the California Consumer Protection ACT but they do n't seem to realize I live in CA. So I stopped paying PayPal and watched the balance double every month. When they finally called one day I told them why I was not paying their charges. They said they would remove all finance charges and late fees but there was still a balance due of {$38.00}. There was no balance due. That payment was purely extortion. My bank XXXX is a large insurance company and they did not want to audit PayPal. If they had requested an audit of the charges they would have realized that it was pure extortion. If you request and audit of that XXXX dollars it would be revealing. There was XXXX balance due. Thanks for all your help. -- XXXXIve asked and disputed with XXXX, asking to provide the documents supporting and proving the ownership of acct, they failed to do such and just updated amounts owed on the acct and closed it, if they can not provide proof of ownership then this needs to be removed from my credit as I have asked them directly multiple times via phone ( not saying someone committed fraud )After getting married in XX/XX/XXXX, I merged bank accounts with my husband in XX/XX/XXXX. That same day, I updated my bank account information on the Great Lakes website ( Student Loan provider ) in order for them to continue to withdraw money on a monthly basis ( auto pay ). In XX/XX/XXXX I logged on to the Great Lakes website, and found out that they never processed the change in bank accounts ; and thus they did not withdraw any payments for the months of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. Once I realized they had not collected any payments, I paid the full amount right away. However, they had already reported me to the credit bureau, and stated that I was " late '' in my payments for over 120 days. I tried contacting Great Lakes and the Department of Education several times, and appealed the negative credit marks stating that was an error on their end. Despite my clean payment history for over 5-7 years, the request was denied. It 's worth mentioning that no calls, letters or emails were sent to me notifying me that no payment had been made on my behalf. That would have alerted me that there was something wrong. I then proceeded to hire XXXX XXXX so they could help me clean my credit and solve this situation. Appeal letters have been sent over the past several months, but nothing has been done by the Department of Educations. This technical error on their end is costing me a low credit score ( that for so many years I so carefully built ), and it is currently impacting my qualifications to purchase a home.XX/XX/2018 I received only 1 notice from some type of Law Office name RAUSCH, STURM, ISREAL, ENERSON & HORNIK LLP. regarding payment options on a written off debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX D/B/A.

They go to the XXXX XXXX complaint. I contacted Experian credit bureau for months attempting to get them to correct my file regarding the XXXX XXXX account. Although they acted like they were going to do something, in the end they not only refused to change it, but told me they wont allow me to attempt to dispute it any further. I sent them copies of the pending court case which was enough for XXXX to remove it, but not good enough for Experian. So instead of reporting it as on litigation hold like were supposed to by law, they showed missed payments and finally a charge-off before it even went to court since they kept sending me continuances until their attorney sent me a fake continuance which the court decided was fine by them and the BAR Assoc. didnt believe it was done on purpose.So it is still affecting my credit score and still unresolved.I still have not heard anything back from this credit bureau.

I was told by Navient ( aka XXXX XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX that my loan would be forgiven in XX/XX/XXXX. Therefor, I did as they suggested an completed the Direct Loan Consolidation so that my loans would qualify ( yet again ) for Public Service loan forgiveness. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my application for consolidation. During that process, it allowed me to complete the Income Based Repayment plan as a part of the process in which I submitted ALL documentation during that session. I was also told to submit my normal IBR application for the original loans that was held by Navient. On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my normal renewal for the IBR. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Navient because I had not received any notification of the status of my Consolidation nor my XXXX. I was told at the time that everything was still in process, and that i was given a 30 day Forbearance so that they would have time to process the consolidation and XXXX without penalizing me. On XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter in the mail that stated that My loan is due for full repayment within 9 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Navient. I spoke with XXXX ID # XXXX. She looked into the issue and noticed that ALL my paper work for the consolidation was completed, but for some ODD reason the IBR was not processed, no one in Navient took any action to process it. She stated that all teh IBR documents were present. And that there was no known reason why my IBR should have not been processed. I expressed to her that Navient has a vendetta against me personally because I keep reporting and complaining about how they treat XXXX Americans conservative XXXX. They intentionally mess up my paper work to cause undo hardship and stress upon my life. The rep stated that she would expedite the IBR application and would send an email out at that moment as proof of our conversation. I never got the email. She also stated that the expedition would take until XX/XX/XXXX. However I explain to her that the forbearance ends XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that Navient would find a way to penalize me for this issue that was NOT my fault. I also told her that everytime I talk  to someone at Navient, each rep tells me something different about my account situation. These people have been lying to me for years. Please help me resolve this issue.XX/XX/XXXX18, Atlantic credit and finance contacted my spouse gave him specific details on my account, such as lack of payment, non payment dates, threats to shut his card off, My spouse is not on any of my accounts nor am I on his.

It was a promotion to transfer a balance with 0 % interest for XXXX billing cycles. I requested a balance transfer of {$10000.00} from another credit card to the new Barclay MasterCard. I received the new card on XXXX/XXXX/2015 with a credit limit of {$1500.00}. Because it was not the credit limit I was hoping for I did n't activate the card and was thinking about closing the account. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I received an email that a {$1000.00} payment posted to the credit card that I asked the {$10000.00} to be transferred to. I still had n't activated the new Barclay card yet and was going to cancel it. I called Barclay customer service and told them that the {$1000.00} was an unauthorized transfer and it happened without my knowledge or consent. They waived the {$30.00} transfer fee but told me that they could n't reverse the charges because it was already paid. I advised them that this was unauthorized transfer and that Barclay did it without authorizing it through me and did the transfer anyway and using an arbitrary amount of their own choosing and an amount other than what I agreed to on the application. I said that since it was in my mind an unauthorized transaction the responsibility of it falls on them to reverse this transaction and the burden to send them money is not on me. They said no, it could n't be done because it already was processed. I requested the new Barclay MarsterCard account to be closed. My point is that since my initial credit card balance was only {$1500.00}, which was way less than the {$10000.00} transfer amount that I requested that the transfer was not going to happen. Furthermore, I had not activated the card and was considering if I was going to keep it or not. It is my view that Barclay acted on their own performing transactions without me knowing about it not verifying with me if these were my wishes. If they would have contacted me and asked if I still wanted to transfer a balance since my initial credit line was way smaller than the transfer amount I requested it would have had a very different outcome. The Results I am requesting to resolve this complaint:XXXX ) Barclay to immediately reverse the {$1000.00} transfer with no cost to me whatsoever.Transunion reporting 90 day late payments on two accounts beyond 7 years.

I have only been able to speak with representatives at XXXX XXXX that tell me they have no authority, and they insist there is no way that i would be allowed to speak with anyone who does.Im continuously harassed while at Wells Fargo bank branches in Arizona.

Upon getting further information she promised she will advise me or provide me more information. On XX/XX/XXXX I called WFB and it was closed so I left voice mail message for XXXX XXXX to return my phone call. On XX/XX/XXXX I called WFB around XXXX XXXX and spoke to staff named XXXX XXXX.

I was told no but I was informed my modification documents has not been received by WFB. Told her I have email confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX it  received and XXXX delivery confirmation. At that point she said XXXX was back on his desk and transferred the call to XXXX. I asked XXXX about funds being returned to XXXX he explained me my documents was supposed to have been received by XX/XX/XXXX and since it was not received by WFB by XX/XX/XXXX funds was returned to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I than told XXXX I received an email conformation on XX/XX/XXXX he never stated in his emailed funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX. I was explained that he never send emails. I told him my email was sent to manger XXXX and it was XXXX who replied conformation. I further told he call me on XX/XX/XXXX which agreed and I told in that recoded conversation he did not mention funds will be returned and documents was supposed to be received by WFB on XX/XX/XXXX. I than told I have received multiple letters mostly from him after XX/XX/XXXX and so do CFPB has received multiple extension none stated funds were returned or will be returned and final date to received modified documents was XX/XX/XXXX. I than requested to speak to his mange and XXXX named manager came on line. She told my issues have been almost competed and I should get response in writing soon. She also stated to me final date to received documents was XX/XX/XXXX. I told her multiple and multiple extension has been received in writing, phone calls and through CFPB none stated about final date to receive modification date was XX/XX/XXXX. I than told her I received email confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX it did not state final date was XX/XX/XXXX and funds has been returned on XX/XX/XXXX. She again told me funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX. She further stated to me she will look to entire stuff and get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. She also stated to me investigation into my complaint dose not indicate there was any problem and all payments and other funds have been properly applied. I called back to CEO XXXX XXXX office spoke to XXXX she told me I have called multiple times and she will have to transfer call to mortgage corporate office and the call was transferred the call. I spoke to XXXX XXXX explained her of the above she asked me she sits next to XXXX XXXX and she had entire conversation and as sated within 24 to 48 hours above issues will be provided. I than asked her of she fax number so I can send email confirmation her. She did provide me her fax number and phone number. I than requested that please answer my calls and return my messages since XXXX XXXX dose not do that. I did set the fax with email confirmation dated XX/XX/XXXX and received phone call from XXXX. I called him back on XX/XX/XXXX he confirmed to me fax was received on XX/XX/XXXX. I again asked XXXX that so many letters was received after XX/XX/XXXX for an extension none sated final date to submit modification documents was XX/XX/XXXX. Neither I was phone discussion with him on XX/XX/XXXX he sated about final date was XX/XX/XXXX. Nor CFPB was informed neither its states in his email funds was returned. He gain reiterated to me he dose not send email and due date was XX/XX/XXXX and funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. Its over 48 hours I have received no information from WFB. I called XXXX spoke to XXXX and she than twisted things little bit and stated to me she was able to see funds being returned on XX/XX/XXXX and funds was received on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me things are done differently in their office it is done electronically. By using electronically funds should not take about one month to be received by XXXX. She did not provide me reason why it took abut one months to received funds. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from XXXX also contradicted herself by stating she could see funds being in process of returned but funds was officially returned on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX never stated to me she could funds being returned on XX/XX/XXXX. Based on my discussion with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I was explained XXXX could see funds are being returned but she had no detail as on that time. My email to her on XX/XX/XXXX confirmation from WFB nothing was stated that on XX/XX/XXXX funds was returned when according WFB funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attached ) also she contradicted herself on XX/XX/XXXX she stated she could see funds were being returned on XX/XX/XXXX but did not mention this to me XX/XX/XXXX. WFB is involved in corruption letters sent to me, phone calls made to and to CFPB no stated funds were returned or last date was XX/XX/XXXX. There was never at any point of time during my phone conversation, email to manager XXXX, letter I was informed last date to receive documents was XX/XX/XXXX. Email conformation attached was dose not indicates that. About 20 email to XXXX XXXX not even singe was replied what I call BULLING AND CORRUPTION. ( Attached ). XXXX has no excuse and that XXXX XXXX was not getting my email. My email with documents emailed to him in which I asked him to confirm me if entire documents were received and he did. Email confirmation which was received on XX/XX/XXXX dose not state funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX.  DOJ and FBI will be filed complaint to investigate this corruption. Even if the funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX never received it until XX/XX/XXXX close to one month late. No funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX but it was received on XX/XX/XXXX and it was re tuned around XX/XX/XXXX. DOJ will and FBI will have investigated this corruption and fraud. It dose not even takes mail to arrive about one month it normally takes 2 days. Here funds were received on XX/XX/XXXX and I have recorded discussion form XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Its just corruption by WFB. I have recorded conversation with XXXX from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX she confirmed to me returned funds was received on XX/XX/XXXX. BULLING AND ADVANTAGE WFB by holding lien is bulling us which I have stated before and stating this. Now. On XX/XX/XXXX I had telephone discussion with XXXX who called me to request for an extension to provide my answers to my dispute items. He did not stated to me in the conversation which is recoded yesterday which was XX/XX/XXXX was last to get the singed documents and it was late. Will provide that recoded conversation. He never stated funds will be returned CORRUPTION AND FRAUD Multiple letters received by XXXX after XX/XX/XXXX dose not states funds was returned because last date to provide singed documents was XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ) WFB is taking advantage its position by holding line that they can decided either way and I have to accept it. From XX/XX/XXXX,  XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I have not received my disputed facts with back up documents why they disagree or agree. ONLY THING I HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT 60 EXTENSIONS Like wise my XX/XX/XXXX letter over close to 100 pages has not been received with back up documents why WFB agrees or disagree. Neither they have provided to CFPB. All WFB has done is kept asking for extension and close to 60 extension has been made to provide me an answers. Despite this manger XXXX insisted with me there is nothing wrong with amount and all are correct. Accounts are not the only issues but there are many other issues and manger XXXX is incompetent state to me all are correct. I will prove her wrong if she ones to get 3 party conference with CFPB and Senator XXXX. As she stated amounts are correct she must leave WFB for stating amounts are correct when attached documents indicates XX/XX/XXXX payments has not been applied to my account. It indicates its sitting in un applied funds. Manager XXXX is incompetent should reign for providing me wrong information which is recorded. Like wise manager XXXX amount on XX/XX/XXXX letter un applied balance was $ {$47.00}, XXXX and modification documents of XX/XX/XXXX was {$73000.00} additional {$25000.00} she just can tell me that is correct but provide me back up copies what extra {$25000.00} has been added for and why. She must provide me beck up documents why {$25000.00} was added so far I have not been provided but illegal, fraud and corruption. RESPA VIOLATION 1. My dispute if XX/XX/XXXX WFB has neither acknowledged within 10 days or provide me any answers within 30 days as required by law. 2. My disputed latter of XX/XX/XXXX was acknowledged within 10 days but I have not been provided any answers or response to my inquiry after 3 months and law require only 30 days to respond to inquiries and not indefinite. 3. My payments of XX/XX/XXXX has neither be credited nor applied to my account or I have been sent refund. 4. My letter sent to WFB to correct the error XX/XX/XXXX has not been either corrected, or I have received any acknowledgment in 10 days or have been provided response within 30 days as required by law. 5. WFB is involved in money laundering payments that was received in XX/XX/XXXX should been credit or applied to my account at that time. Its been close to 4 years my payments has neither been credited nor applied to my account. Neither have I been provided refund as per my request in my email letters which included on XX/XX/XXXX 6. WFB refused to provide me why {$25000.00} was added with back up documents for close three months. Law requires them to provide me my inquiry to be responded within 30 days. 7. WFB has not provided any back up documents why it has overpaid escrow account for close to 11 months and law requires them to provide me inquiries within 30 days. 8. XX/XX/XXXX I left message at XXXX XXXX not received no phone call. Called him about noon he told he had not heard his message. I asked home to give me brake down of {$73000.00}. He told me he can only give principal balance of {$120000.00} and escrow has negative $ XXXX but can not give answer to interest he is still doing research and he has time until XX/XX/XXXX to respond, ON XX/XX/XXXX PHONE CONVERSATION HE DID NOT STATE HE HAS NOT RECEIVED MODIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND I HAD LAST DATE WAS XX/XX/XXXX AND HE HAS NOT RECEIVED THE DOCUMENTS 9. ON THE PHONE CONVERSATION HE DID NOT STATED HE NOT RECEIVED MODIFICATION DOCUMENTS AND I HAD LAST DATE WAS XX/XX/XXXX AND HE HAS NOT RECEIVED THE DOCUMENTS RETALIATION After I asserted my rights to file complaints with Senator XXXX XXXX, Congress XXXX, Assemblyman XXXX XXXX, Comptroller of Currency, FTC, Attorney General of IA, Attorney General of CA etc. WFB has just retaliated with me by returning funds to XXXX after some time in XX/XX/XXXX and now lying to me funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. Its dose not takes close to one month any types fund to be returned close to one month or 25 days via electronic fund transfer. Its also fraud to state to me on XX/XX/XXXX funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX neither in any letters after XX/XX/XXXX states, in any email to the manager, to CFPB and phone conversation stated to me funds will be returned after XX/XX/XXXX. None of the letters attached after XX/XX/XXXX states funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. Its part of retaliation for me asserting my rights after WFB its has been bulling us, violating laws and retaliating against me. No funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX and no funds were received around XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX. No funds were received by XXXX anytime in XX/XX/XXXX this is just simple Fraud and Corruption. Funds was received XX/XX/XXXX dose not indicates its was ever returned on XX/XX/XXXX and is part of retaliation. Multiple letters ( attached ) received after XX/XX/XXXX dose not indicate final date was XX/XX/XXXX to send singed documents. Neither it stated funds were already returned is part of retaliation. Like wise CFPB has received multiple notice of extension of time to provide response to my inquiry and none stated final date to provide since documents was XX/XX/XXXX also of if retaliation. I WOULD LIKE REITERATE WELL FARGO NEVER DISCUSS WITH ME ANY TIME FUNDS WILL BE RETURNED AFTER XX/XX/XXXX IF DOCUMENTS WERE RETURNED BEFORE THAN NEITHER I WAS INFORMED IN ANY WAY FUDS WERE RETURNED ON XX/XX/XXXX. I ONLY CAME KNOW FUNDS WERE BEING RETURNED THROUGH XXXX AFTER I HAD SEND EMAIL TO FIND OUT THE STATUES OF MODIFICATION ONCE AGAIN THIS IS NEW COMPLAINT THAT DEVELOPED ON XX/XX/XXXX AND IT SHOULD BE ADDED TO MY OLD COMPLAINT SUCH AS XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ETC ; AND DATE OF COMPLAINT FILED IN XX/XX/XXXX.I have double charges by merchants, and very large unacceptable fees by bank. I have had double charges by merchants for many many years, this has caused my banking to become a full time job.Account should be closed paid in full on time monthlyAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.I carry a balance on my Chase Freedom card with a promotional 0 % rate. I made additional purchases on the account in XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX, which is charged interest as soon as the charges hit the account. Prior to the next statement date, I paid the minimum amount due plus the full amount of the new purchases. I assumed that Chase would apply the amount in excess of the minimum amount due to the purchase balance, as the law requires that payment in excess of the minimum be applied to the balance with the highest interest. Chase applied the full payment to the 0 % balance. I called Chase and I was told that the excess payment was not applied to the purchases since they were not on the prior monthly statement and are not considered a " balance '' for payment allocation. I do not think the Credit Card Act of XX/XX/XXXX allows that. If I am charged interest on the purchases, it should be considered a " balance '' on the account for payment allocation, regardless of whether it appeared on a statement or not.I have a collection account on my credit report maintain under my Social Security number from a collection agency the Bureaus Inc stating I owe {$10000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed them a certified letter formally requesting validation of the debt pursue to the Fair Debt Collection Practies Act. I requested validation that is competent evidence bearing my signature showing that I have or ever had some contractual obligation to pay them. I also stated that it is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practies Act if they can not verify the debt they must notify all XXXX credit bureau 's to remove/delete the entry. The United States Post Office had made two attempts to deliver a certified letter to Bureaus Inc address listed on my credit reports from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX. The United States post office returned a letter to me XX/XX/XXXX.I notify all XXXX credit bureau 's listed above in this complaint the address provided for ( Bureaus Inc ) by their agenciesand the post office was unable to deliver my certified letter that 's violating my due process of an adverse action as I was seeking to get information of this debt filed under my Social Security number. I asked all XXXX credit bureau 's to validate the information with Bureaus Inc and provide me with copies of any documentation associated with this account bearing my signature and stated to them in the absence of any such documentation bearing my signature I formally request that the information immediately be deleted from their credit file maintain under my security number. I also mentioned in my letter in accordance with section of statute 611 you are required to remove this account from my credit report as it is undeniable proof of and in accuracy of a reporting on my credit history. The three major credit bureaus stated that the information is correct upon looking at my credit reports Bureaus Inc updated my XXXX credit report on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX was updated on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX what 's updated on XX/XX/XXXX. As verified how could Bureaus Inc validate my Debt and yet at the same time refuse to except my certified letter asking for verification and validation of any evidence bearing my signature of this account. I believe that Bureaus Inc is acting in bad faith, and not have complied with the Federal Trades Commission 15 USC 41, et seq. Subchapter V Debt Collector Practices. I feel that they are liable for willful noncompliance as per FCRA 807 false and misleading representation [ 15 USC 1962e ] for their unwillingness to except my certified letter requesting validation of the debt.There should be an easy way to freeze my credit report on all 3 agencies. I have tried to do this online with all 3 agencies and after much time, all 3 errored out with vague error messages that " my request could not be completed at this time ''. This is unacceptable.XXXX, Credit Reporting Agency has made it difficult for a consumer to dispute erroneous information on a credit file.

If Equifax can not or chooses not to conduct an investigation of the same ( 3 ) accounts that are being reported by XXXX and XXXX, then I request for a copy of my credit file be sent by email to XXXX or by regular USPS to my current mailing address. I attached a copy of my ID and a recent utility bill with the address where I been living for the last ( 4 ) years.XXXX XXXX is reporting a paid as agree a, with no late payments, as 60-90 or more late. I have tried countless times to contact company who does not answer as well as have spent countless hours trying to resolve this matter and to date this has not been corrected permanately. I have stressed my concerns and frustrations to XXXX and Trans Union and have been told that the merchant has updated my file when I am advising them that the information is incorrect. I have sent all documentation that was provided by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as New York XXXX XXXX XXXX. They reporting agencies ( Trans Union and XXXX ) will updated the information to report correctly and not even 72 hours later, they will change the reporting back to the incorrect information. I am in need of help getting them to STOP reporting incorrect information as the merchant has admitted to incorrectly reporting information.Three years ago, roughly, I partially applied for a loan at XXXX XXXX. As the final step the woman on the phone wanted to have a recorded conference call with my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The bank rep asked some pointed questions, and I told them thank you, but I did not want the loan. No money was put into my bank account ( The bank closed and I can not get records now ). XXXX XXXX has declined to provide proof of their supposed deposits, and their own phone recording has me repeatedly saying " NO '' ( the woman would n't get off the phone and I finally hung up ). They became a nuisance in attempting to collect a non-loan, and I filled a police report with the XXXX County Sherriff 's Dept. in 2014. Now I am getting calls at work from National Credit Adjusters, XXXX.I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days past due XXXX, 60 days XXXX, 90 days XXXX, 120 days XXXX, 180 days XXXX I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me.The federal loan company has turned over my student loans which went into default to a collection agency Action Financial Service LLC And I’ve had the most difficult time reaching them. I would like to get my loans out of default and start building myself back up but no one is answering me no one is reaching out to me if you check the reviews of this company, I’m basically doomedI have a student loan balance from XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX on my Experian credit report that is incorrect. This balance, paid in full, is correct on my XXXX and XXXX credit reports. I tried to file a dispute with Experian to resolve this. This student loan was paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX and it is still showing a balance on my Experian file. When I received the dispute resolvement letter from Experian today, XX/XX/XXXX and it was not corrected (??? ), I followed directions on the letter and called XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX representative told me that they reported to Experian on XX/XX/XXXX that the account had a XXXX balance, and was paid in full in good standing. I then called Experian to try to resolve this. First, it is almost impossible to get to talk to someone in the dispute center, when I finally navigated my way there, the representative was very rude, disrespectful, and unhelpful. I told her that I had documentation and that they had received the same documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX. She informed me that the company stated there was no change in my account so that is why they ( Experian ) made no effort to correct my account. So if that is what XXXX XXXX XXXX told them, 'no change in my account ', there was no change because the account had been paid in full since XX/XX/XXXX. There seems to be a little bit of effort that needs to be put forth by Experian when 2 of 3 credit reporting agencies show a XXXX balance and they don't, to maybe dig a tiny bit deeper into the issue. The Experian representative very rudely told me to mail in or upload my letter, told me to have a nice day, and hung up. There is obviously a disconnect between these credit reporting agencies and the credit companies. These companies are in control of the things we can finance as well as the jobs we can get, so it would be great if they were actually working for us and not against us.XXXX ATTN : Customer Care XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX : Incorrect data/information with Membership ID XXXX Login : XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( DOB XX/XX/XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( DOB XX/XX/XXXX ) On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, both myself and XXXX opened accounts with Experian to access our credit reports individually. As we became familiar with the site, we decided to change to the Family plan membership. We then, canceled XXXX account and added her to mines. Since the account change took place, my name was removed from my account and replaced with XXXX name. I see my credit report, SSN # and DOB, but under her name. In efforts to correct the data, I removed XXXX as an adult on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my information was still being presented with XXXX name. I cancelled my family membership on XX/XX/XXXX and tried to reopen the account with only my information. The system did not let me open a new account and prompted me to login with my XXXX login. The information has yet been corrected. We created the Experian account in order to dispute charges when needed and to lock our identity. I have been unsuccessfully reaching the customer service department at, XXXX, which is why Im writing this letter. I ask that someone please look into the data that appears on our accounts. Ideally, we would like a family plan, but if it is going to cause an issue, then we would like separate accounts with our information fully segregated. If you have any questions, please contact me at XXXX. I have enclosed screenshots of what we see when we log in. Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXXAccount was closed due to fraud activity per bank of america, Check was deposit into account & funds was never withdrawn from the account and when check was returned, account was closed.

Equal Housing Lender XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. All rights reserved. This email was sent to : XXXX XXXXI was part of the XXXX credit information hack. I find it unacceptable that I have to PAY to freeze my credit when I did n't consent to my information being stored by XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX in the first place. Congress should make credit freezes and unfreezes free federally. Credit reporting agencies already make money off of my information and I should not be required to pay them additional money to protect my information, especially when they are doing a POOR job in the first place. Thank you for taking time to read my complaint.Nationstar doubled my payment based upon an error in their escrow analysis. XX/XX/2015 they increased my escrows for property taxes to {$330.00} a month. My property taxes are only {$730.00} every 6 months. or {$120.00} a month. I have tried in vein to get this issue corrected and I have proof that Nationstar was made aware of the issues in written correspondence dated XXXXI have offered to make principal and interst payments but was advised that I need to get escrows corrected first. Now i am four months behind. They have no record of my issues and have started a foreclosure action. They also sent in a crew to winterize the property and they did damage.to my property. RESPA doesnt allow Nationstar to collect that excessive amount of property taxes. And obviously this type of service abuse shows that predatory lending still existsI had a credit card with XXXX gas. I paid it off in full in 2013 and a XXXX and a XXXX i received a letter from XXXX ( a collection agency for Synchrony Bank ) saying that I owe them {$250.00} and they reported me to the XXXX major credit agencies. Always pay my bills. I have a XXXX FICO score and I do n't want anything to ruin it. I paid the money ( in protest ) but I notified Synctrony Bank ( in writing ) that i was never notified about owning anything on this XXXX credit card but they refuse to remove the negative statement from my credit report. These guy 's are crooks both Synchrony and XXXX,Debt recovery co. Enhanced Recovery filed false claim, I spoke with co. they claimed I owe and that co. has no unpaid bills under my name plus I never lived at address they have on file. I filed a complaint last year with your guys about same acct against XXXX XXXX, both of these co 's have multiple complaints from consumers about these co 's filing false claims under fake accts to extort payments. They claim I owe {$440.00} and sent negative report to my credit report on XX/XX/19 and XX/XX/19.I continuously receive calls to my personal cell phone from Monarch Recovery, XXXX, regarding my ex-husband. They identify themselves as a recovery agency ( sometimes ) and ask for him by name. I have told them numerous, repeated times that this is not his phone, we do not have a legal or financial relationship, and I have variously provided his contact information and also asked them to stop calling. I receive a call from this number almost daily and sometimes during working hours XX/XX/2016, and at least weekly during XX/XX/XXXX. I have added them to my auto-block list on my cell phone to avoid the annoying and disruptive contacts. I found out that they are also calling my mom ( his ex-mother in law ), who has even less history with him. This firm obviously has my ex-husband 's current contact information, as I discussed the incident with him and he was aware of the firm and had been contacted by them as well. It should n't be OK to repeatedly contact disinterested third parties just for the sake of annoying them into pestering a person ( over whom they have no control ) into paying their debt.CREDIT SYSTEM INTERNATIONAL CLAIMS I OWE A {$39.00} DEBT Date Date Created : XX/XX/XXXX Date Debt/Collection : XX/XX/XXXX Amount of Debt : {$39.00} I ask the Debt Collection Company to properly investigate this debt and they have refused to do so which is in direct violation of the fair debt collection laws. If this company does not accept my dispute request then I will file a complaint with the FTC and the Attorney General 's Office of Texas. I am told by this Debt Collection Company that this Debt is in favor of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I'm not sure how this debt was created but this debt was not created by me.I have tried several times to get XXXX  XXXX XXXX to correct the current payment status on a loan transferred from them to XXXX XXXX. Their representative called to update me on the progress XX/XX/2019 and said they believe the payment status is being reported properly. I asked how a statement in plain english on my credit report saying I am currently past due on a loan closed 3 years ago could be accurate, and she asked me to fax any further documentation I had to her, and someone would look into it. I did that, but no one looked at it, or at least contacted me back. Evidently XXXX  XXXX XXXX used that phone call as a successful completion of CFPB complaint.Navient encouraged me to defer my loans. They are reporting late payments and will not remove them from my credit report, although I have never made ANY payments to my account. My loans are still deferred, 6 years later, due to unemployment. I have a XXXX credit score because of this.I had previously sent small amounts of funds to friends in XXXX this past 30 days. I think four times.Then about 10 days ago, i went to Western Union to do another wire transfer. Cancelled and I was blocked. Came back a couple of days still could not send funds international.Tried XXXX this past week with same results. Tried XXXX XXXX this week could not send. Said I was blocked. DO not know who or why i would be blocked internationally. Not their authority to block sending funds to assist friends in a third world country. Have filed complaint with Western Union XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019. Sent requested additional info they requested on XX/XX/2019. Maximum I send is about {$500.00} USD.  Don't do this often. Filed complaint with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 under similar circumstances. Name was blocked trying to find out who or what government agency. I need your assistance. Who oversees International Wire Transfers in the US government. Is it CFPB?XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX wants to charge me administrative fees, interest, and penalties. I departed XXXX XXXX on terminal leave in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX paid final separation payment in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX In XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX alleges they overpaid the separation amount. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent notices of the alleged debt to XXXX XXXX, per XXXX by phone XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, the base I separated from. None were sent to my home address. Meanwhile XXXX has been sending XXXX Account Statements to my home address in XXXX, XXXX XXXX In XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reported this alleged debt delinquent to the Transunion Credit Bureau in violation of the law. The change in my credit rating was the XXXX notice I received of the actions XXXX was taking. Upon becoming aware of the Transunion report I contacted XXXX, said contact is still being ignored by XXXX. I will be at their office in XXXX later this week to investigate. Are there other retired military members who have had their financial reputations harmed by the actions of XXXX? Is it time for a class action lawsuit?XXXX XXXX XXXX Assignee of XXXX XXXX send a letter on XX/XX/XXXX to me and my employer. The letter said they want to collect the amount of {$2900.00} from my salary. The credit card with this bank was close in XX/XX/XXXX. I believe this is an unfair action and I am very disappoint because I never receive any letter prior from XXXX or the court letting know about any issues.I got approved for a modification by my mortgage servicer caliberhomeloans my loan holder XXXX XXXX XXXX i made all my payments never missed a payment from XX/XX/2018 through XX/XX/2018 in XXXX caliberhomeloans notified me they where transferring my mortgage payment over to XXXX XXXX ...

My partner and I submitted our documents together. Our documents contains our personal information, financial information, tax records, from our social security to our pensions together were all submitted to her. After completing submitting all the documents, I never hear from her anymore. I called and left messages and emailing her and still no response from her. After couple of days, I called back again and the sales department told me that she was no longer working there and he told me, the manager will be calling me. I never received any calls anyone of them until now. Just our concerned was, " where are our documents ''? Are they safe? Are they with XXXX XXXX? Despite of my calls and e-mails to this company, nobody will email me back at least will tell us what was happening? They claim that has been in business for 20 years helping families, but it seems that they are scammers getting personal financial information to innocent family like us. This company should be flag giving warning to the public.I am filling this complaint because XXXX has ignored my request to provide me with the documents that their company has on file that was used to verify these accounts, under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA - they are required to " ... promptly delete all information which can not be verified. '' that I have disputed. Please resolve this matter as soon as possibleThey have failed to block accounts resulting from identity theft from my credit report even though I provided my affidavit and police report as well as a letter detailing that my information was stolen and used by another party. In addition, I have paperwork which explicates that another party used my name in a criminal matter therefore I am not responsible for the accounts that do not belong to me. Not only did they fail to block this information, they failed to give me the documentation that proves that these accounts even belong to me. I did receive a letter stating that these accounts were verified as mine and that they are declining my request to block these accounts. To legally verify, Congress states that they must have firsthand knowledge of these accounts and they did NOT! Before I speak with my attorney, I 'm giving a goodwill attempt for the last time to rectify this. Pursuant to section FCRA 603 ( o ) ( 5 ) ( A ) ( i ; iii ), I did not give authorization for you to report these accounts in the first place, nor did I give the creditor permission to report these nor did I give permission to the court to report these. # 1 I was a victim of identity theft which means that these items must be removed immediately # 2 you do not have the authorization to report this bankruptcy which is also reporting inaccurately! XXXX XXXX Account # XXXX where 's the documentation that proves ownership of this company? I did not open this account nor did I apply for it - remove this immediately!

XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not have any animals. My dog was put down years ago at XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, they know that and have proof of that. What happened is that my son went there with his dog. My son is XXXX and I am not sure why the appointment is listed under my name. We do not have the same name or address. When I called the agency and complained the agent said she did not believe me and did nothing.This is not my debt. I do not owe this debt, my son owes this debt.I have attached a copy of the status page from Transunion. By law, they have exceeded the the 30 days allowed for the verification of this item. Transunion must now remove this item immediately.I C System failed to provide any initial communication within 5 days of obtaining this debt that was originally was resold from another debt collector and is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, section 809. In addition I C System hasn't been able to provide any original application or verification obligating me to the debt in question. I C System must cease and desist all collection efforts until the necessary documentation is produced, and immediately remove this account from all 3 consumer reporting agencies if unable to do so.I have a XXXX account reporting on my Equifax report. They 've showed it verified and they wont reinvestigate. XXXX and XXXX were n't able to verify that same account. During the time of my investigation was the same time that Equifax had security breech. The name on the XXXX account and the name on my Credit Report does n't match up. I know that because XXXX sent a letter to my home with a different name on it. This account is reporting and it is costing me XXXX points of my credit score. My XXXX and XXXX XXXX are in the XXXX 's. I do n't know what else to do besides send another complaint. Knowing my information may have been compromised during my disputing process and knowing I 'm being penalized would only lead me to take lawful action. All Im asking is that this account be deleted so that I can live my life for my family and get the best interest rates to purchase items that I know I am credit worthy for.All of my major credit bureaus are correctly reporting that I have no public records. A former bankruptcy was properly deleted in XXXX 2019. However, they continue to say I have a bankruptcy on their XXXX score which all three of the major compile. I would like it removed.( a ) XXXX.

When I made my purchase I was only offered 5 years No Interest. We went to Furniture Row at XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX TX on XXXX and met with XXXX to purchase a Tempurpidic bed and foundation for {$4600.00} for the advertised 7 years no interest. The advertisement said " Offer available on approved singles or combined store purchases totaling {$3900.00} or more of qualifying merchandise made between XXXX/XXXX/15 and XXXX/XXXX/15 on an open and current Furniture Row Express Money card issued by Capital One , N.A . '' I have an open Furniture Row Express Money Card with an available credit of {$4700.00}. When I went to purchase I was told that they would only give me 5 years no interest. XXXX called Capital One on XXXX and said that my credit account is not in the correct tier to get 7 years and they could only offer 5 years. I called Capital One on XXXX and they said that this is Furniture Rows decision to offer 7 years not Capital One 's and I need to take it up with the store manager as they do not make the promotions. I filled out the paper work on XXXX with XXXX at Furniture Row to make the purchase by calling back in on the phone the next day after a discussed this with Capital One. I went ahead and made the purchase over the phone and received the 5 years XXXX interest. I have filed a XXXX complaint against Furniture Row. The complaint went unresolved and Furniture Row said that this is an issue with Capital One. I have called Capital One again and asked for something in writing to explain how I have a credit card that is in a different tier and can be denied the 7 years but given 5 years no interest. They said that they do not have anything in writing and offered to send me a credit card agreement. I have received the credit card agreement and there is nothing in it that states that I can be denied an advertised 7 year no interest and given a lower tier of 5 years no interest. This is false advertising that lead me into the store to make a purchase for 7 years no interest and then have it not offered to me even though I already had the approved credit card and credit limit to make the purchase.Hello I recently I went to court and was ordered to pay XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$320.00} for pro-rated rent. XX/XX/XXXX I have attached my proof to this complaint. The collection agency has put a crazy amount on all three credit bureau for XXXX. I do not owe this amount. I have already paid what I owed. I'm currently in the process of buying a home and this is impacting my process. I need the company to remove this collection from all three credit bureau 's. I need them to produce a lease with my signature for XX/XX/XXXX showing I owe this debt.I started at XXXX XXXX XXXX in 2002 in XXXX VA. They made me use my parents income even though I did n't even live with them. Some how I ended up with 4 separate loans and I had no ideal what I was getting myself into back then. The loans went to XXXX first which is the company that used my social security number to obtain a loan through XXXX XXXX XXXX without my permission. They took that money and paid the government loans off and began adding interest. After several years they passed the loans onto Navient and added more money.Now Navient is telling me that I still owe the government and that As of now I owe them XXXX in accrued interest. And every payment made has to go to the interest and fees first before the principal amount that was originally borrowed. Thats so that they will still have a large loan amount to add interest to because if the loan amount were smaller that would be less interest for them to add. It is totally unfair to have to pay Navient XXXX for money that I did not borrow. I 've ask Navient for a copy of the promissory note that they claim I signed but I still have not received any proof. Also I called XXXX XXXX College for proof and they have changed names since 2002 and do n't have any information on me because they said that they did n't scan documents back then but they maybe able to find something signed in some storage place where they send old files but maybe not. It 's a complete scam from both XXXX XXXX and Navient and XXXX. They are trying to collect money that is n't owed. I dont know what to do! I need help with this to get these loans removed and to file a law suit if possible. And as far as XXXX taking a loan out with XXXX XXXX XXXX with my Social Security Number is complete fraud. They said it was an electronic signature. I bet it was because It was n't me. If it takes giving this degree back to XXXX XXXX College thats fine with me. It 's useless anyway since they 've changed names twice and ripped so many people off. I have never once use the so called degree. I just want my life back. At this point I ca n't get a car loan or a home loan do to my credit being destroyed by these schools loans. If I owe XXXX in accrued interest that is the same amount of my fourth loan with Navient so Technically I should n't have a fourth loan. I 've paid what I owed over these 15 years a long time ago. Please help me prove that Navient XXXX and XXXX XXXX College have committed fraud against me and probably many others. Thank you for any help that you can provide and God Bless.On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my account so I could transfer money to cover a check I had just written. I found that my account was at minus XXXX. I had been overdrawn XXXX and 3 additional charges under {$2.00} each came through along with a sustained overdraft charge of {$30.00}. I was not informed by the bank until after the charge so I couldn't correct it. I also didn't transfer the money for the check because this fee was beyond what I had. I had just received an annual report about protection if charges under {$5.00} come in. I have since received a {$35.00} overdraft fee for the check I couldn't cover because of this ridiculous sustained fee. It appears they are charging me another {$30.00} sustained overdraft fee. This is excessive considering the initial overdraft was less than a dollar.I have had my Wells Fargo dealer services account for over four years and have never been late on a payment. Around XX/XX/XXXX I left the country for a while ( job related ) and prior to leaving payed my monthly bill as well as set up an auto payment system with my account, seeing that I would have little access to the internet or phone. When I returned in XX/XX/XXXXI was immediately bombarded with calls from Wells Fargo dealer services stating that my account had entered a 90 Day derogatory status. I spoke to multiple people online letting them know that I had set up an auto payment system, and was basically told they had no record of me asking to do that and tough luck. I tried to hold out and contact someone to help prove that I had asked for this but my credit score became negatively effected as well as Wells Fargo having collection agents call my phone every half hour asking for me to pay the month that I missed while I was gone. I would like to know that if there is no record of me setting up an auto payment system, how did the other months that I was gone get paid out, but one was missing. In the end I ended up paying near {$500.00} dollars ( as opposed to the {$210.00} I usually pay ) and my credit score took a massive hit in order to get the account back active.I 'm using Discover credit card for three months I have earned around XXXX $ cashback and in the end of the first year, they promised to give another same amount on how much we earned as cashback. But they suddenly closed my account without any prior notice so I enquired today they said I had made a payment last month that has been returned back.. actually, I did n't make any payment it was unauthorized so they had added the penalty to my statement I showed up some clarity and canceled my penalty charges. Now, they closed my account and took my XXXX $ cashback n saying that due to security issues they closed!! it can not be reopened you lost the cashback, you can reapply credit card again without any old reward! this also cost me to lose credit score!! this I suspect some fraudulent. They 're not loyal to the customer if we earn more cashback they igniting some errors and closing the account ... this problem faced by a lot of people ... I read it in few websites ... I need my cash back!! n I do n't want to lose my credit score without doing any fault.I had a private student loan issued by XXXX XXXX XXXX in about XXXX to attend XXXX XXXX University in XXXX, MD. After graduating from college I had some difficulty repaying that loan and in turn XXXX sold the loan to a collection agency. Once the loan went into collections I made arrangements with the debt collector and have been making on time payment in full as scheduled. My complaint is that these payments are not being reported to the credit bureaus.I had a bank account with Wells Fargo, through which I also had a linked credit card that had a " protection plan '' on it for if I was ever hurt or laid off, and therefore unable to make payments. After years of paying the fees for it, when it came time to use the service ( I was laid off ) they made one payment for me then refused to pay any more. I sent in the appropriate paperwork then XXXX letters requesting the service be turned on, before I finally had to file bankruptcy and lost everything I owned. This was not my only credit card at the time, but it was one of the few with payment protection and it could have made a large difference, especially because I ended up being overdrawn and losing the bank account due to their overdraft fees - they would not stop charging against the account, *even after it was closed*. I never received a single response to any of the letters I sent requesting the service I had paid them for years for.I deposited {$6500.00} using ACH and I can not withdraw my money. I already submitted CFPB complaint a 3 month ago, and they simply replied that I was able to access my fund which is total lie. I need my money back. When I called their customer service, they kept me in an egg-chicken situation where there is no solution. The egg-chicken situation is : In order to access USD fund, they need to perform country-change in my account. But to change the country, they need to empty any fund in USD. It has been a quarter of year since I started complaint. And Coinbase simply has done nothing except lying about my case and keeping me in a fraudulent loop.I applied and was approved for a loan from SoFi on XXXX XXXX. Signed and submitted the acceptance paperwork on XXXX XXXX. Since then, every employee has given me a different story on when the funds will be in my account. I 've been told on three different occasions the funds were ACH 'd into my account and would be available in a few business days. I was given other deadlines by two additional employees for when the funds would be available and those, too, have came and passed. The customer service representatives have no more information available to them than I do when viewing my application online, and I 'm being told that the fate of these funds is in the hands of a funding department that no one can contact, has access to, or has a phone number for. A supervisor was supposed to get me a transaction tracking number and call me back, she never did. I spoke with another supervisor who told me the funds were approved XXXX XXXX, and I have yet to see them. At this point I think I was the victim of a fraudulent scam aimed to obtain personally identifiable information from consumers. The interest rate on my acceptance paperwork is actually higher than what I was approved for, and that paperwork says I have a payment due on XXXX XXXX, even though I never received a dollar from this company. At the very least, this is an inefficient, misleading, and dishonest company who flat out lies to consumers. Worst case scenario, it 's a complete scam.XXXX XXXX has contacted my personal phone, and my employers phone 6 to 7 times a day each. it has been asked on numerous times not to call my employer because I can not receive personal phone calls at work. a gentleman on the phone that calls is using abusive language, arrogant and demanding information from both my employer and is discussing what the debt isIn regards to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SD XXXX. I filed for a late payment verification over the phone and thru certified mail. Both times came back as verified accurate. When I made on time payments and never missed but XXXX XXXX XXXX continues to report inaccurately, I 've asked them to show me proof and validate there late payment claim, when I paid on time and there 's no records. When I have asked to see - they have never shown me. I 'm so upset that I know no other remedy but to file a complaint about this situation, apparently they had a system glitch around that time or human error was made on there part and they will not remove the late paymentCredit bureau is in violation of FCRA, GRAMM- LEACH- BLILEY ACT and 49 CFR 801.56 among  others.My car was crashed, and Capital One Auto Finance seems to be involved in unfair practices. The following is notes that I have kept : Timeline of Incidences After Crash XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  Car crash ( No injuries, No other vehicle-car vs. tree ) XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida Highway Patrol made traffic crash report, XXXX XXXX   received a text from an officer advising vehicle towed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX to their tow yard in XXXX Florida. Also, the trooper advised the report would be emailed to me. XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX ( I am unsure which date they called because I was confused about how they were involved at this point ) I received a call from Capital One Auto Finance requesting my intention with the car. I advised I was claiming it on my insurance. Capital One did not ask for my insurance information. I was thanked for my great payment record, and the representative ended the call. XX/XX/XXXX I was waiting for the crash report to provide to insurance but decided since Capital One was inquiring, I needed to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX. A report was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX and forwarded to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. I received an email from XXXX, providing my claim number and claim representatives name ( XXXX XXXX ). XX/XX/XXXX I emailed Ms. XXXX regarding the fact that I had the only key that the appraiser will probably need it to appraise the car. I also needed a rental car before the weekend. She called me and said to drop the key at the tow yard and provided me with rental information.I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to drop off key after XXXX, and I asked if there was a dropbox. They advised I would need to meet a driver at the lot and to give them a 90-minute head start to have a driver available. I left work an hour and a half early to get to the lot before XXXX, so I wouldn't have to meet someone. I got there around XXXX XXXX, and no one was in the office even though there was an open sign on the door. I called XXXX 's XXXX again, and the woman was irritated that I didn't let them know in advance that I would be in before XXXX XXXX. I said I was sorry ; I thought she said I had to give them notice if I was coming after XXXX XXXX. I waited on the driver and provided him with the key. I wanted to retrieve my belongings, but I didn't have my registration, so I said I would be back the following day. XX/XX/XXXX I went to the tow yard and advised the registration must be in the car. I was able to take my property, including my car tag. I signed a release statement to release the car to the insurance company, then went to XXXX to pick up my rental. In the meantime, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX sent an appraiser to check the vehicle at the tow yard. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail from the appraiser ( XXXX XXXX ). I called him back and was advised that he couldn't see the damage under the hood. He asked which body shop to send the car. They will know more after getting the car on a lift. I advised I wanted it sent to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, FL. XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Ms. XXXX advising the car was repairable. She asked which body shop we wanted to use. I advised ( again ) XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I said I told the appraiser the same yesterday. I said since it was not at the body shop yet, I was curious if the appraisal was completed. She assured me it was, and said she would send a check in my name along with my husband, and XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I received the check in the mail. Also, I received a notice from the post office that I had certified mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I wasn't overly concerned about the certified mail from XXXX XXXX XXXX because I thought the car was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX Monday morning to find out when I should bring the check. XXXX did not have my car. I then called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they advised that my car was picked up by the lienholder ( Capital One Auto Finance ). I then called Capital One and spoke with someone named XXXX ( no last name provided ) and was advised they picked up my car to secure it because the tow yard could auction it off if it stayed there too long. I let them know that it was in the middle of an insurance claim. He asked for my claim #, insurance agency name, and claim representatives information. He said someone at Capital One would call the insurance representative and determine how to get the car to the right place. He also sent a fraud claim resolution letter to my email address naming me as a victim and stating the trade line would be deleted from my credit reports. Email sent to Ms. XXXX to advise the situation. She didn't understand why the lienholder was involved. She thought I called them. I told her I did not. I told her they would contact her. Also, I mentioned again that I thought the appraisal was not complete. She advised that it was ; that the body shop could request supplemental checks if necessary. XX/XX/XXXX I emailed Ms. XXXX asking if Capital One contacted her yet. XX/XX/XXXX Email received from Ms. XXXX, no contact from Capital One. I called Capital One again. I spoke with XXXX ( no last name provided ) I was told they could not speak with Ms. XXXX because she wasn't on my account. He asked how I intended to pay the impound and repossession fees. I said that I wasn't, insurance should cover me. I provided permission for Ms. XXXX to call and straighten everything out. Ms. XXXX called Capital One and was advised the fees must be paid by debit card. They wouldn't accept a check from insurance. She called me back. She said I could pay upfront, and insurance would pay me back. I said I don't have money. This is not my fault. She said to get Capital One to provide a bill, and they would send me a check, then I could cash it and pay for the fees. I called Capital One back and didn't get the person 's name ( all calls were recorded ) and asked for the bill, so insurance could pay and was told they do not have the ability to print the bill/invoice. Maybe I could stop at a Capital One store. I asked where I might find a Capital One store, and the man said he didnt know. I looked for one, and the closest is over 200 miles away. Email back to Ms. XXXX to ask for the fee information because I was at the hospital all day as my grandchild was being born, so I didn't have paper and pen or time to write the amounts down. She emailed me back with the info and then said they could only cover the impound fee ( {$350.00} ), not the repossession fee ( {$290.00} ). I called the impound yard ( XXXX XXXX ) to get a bill to provide to the insurance company. I was given the number to the actual lot ( XXXX XXXX ). I had to leave my phone number for a callback. Another call to Capital One advising they should waive the repo fee because it was not my fault. The car is paid in advance every month. I was told by XXXX ( she provided her id " XXXX '' ) that they could email me a reinstatement notice that will only show the total of both the repo and impound fees. She said she could help by putting {$190.00} of the repo fee to the end of my loan, but everything has to be paid upfront. Checked mailbox for physical mail ( none received ) and put signed USPS to leave the certified letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX so I could see precisely what Capital One received. XX/XX/XXXX Checked mail for any notices. ( none received ) XX/XX/XXXX No email received from Capital One. No callback from the impound lot. I called Capital One. XXXX ( Id # XXXX ) answered. I advised I needed a supervisor. He forwarded me to their Customer Advocacy Team. I spoke to XXXX ( ID # XXXX ). I complained that I did not receive a bill. She said there was an issue with emailing it to me. I explained that no one contacted me before picking up the vehicle. She said she would check to see if anyone called. I said if they called, they would have needed to leave a voicemail, which they did not. XXXX said it would have only been as a courtesy anyway. She said I was in breach of my contract. I said, It makes no sense that I have paid all payments on time, and the car was taken while insurance was handling the claim. How am I in breach of my contract? She didnt have an answer. I was not notified in any way so that I could attempt to contact the insurance rep to get the car removed into their custody. She said I would be receiving a notice of intent in the mail. I said, Ok, so Im receiving it in the mail, which will take more time. I thought the issue was saving tow yard fees. It is sitting in an impound lot now. She put me on hold. When she returned, she stated that the letter was being emailed to me, which included the {$290.00} repo fee. ( I suppose the deal to add {$190.00} to the end of my loan is off the table. ) We ended the call. I emailed XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. The following is the email in its entirety : Good morning. I finally got Capital One to provide a document. I can not pay the fee for the repossession, and they refuse to waive it. They said Capital One attempted to contact your office before impounding it. The point is that I didn't receive notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Capital, nor your office advising me that the car was being repossessed. I know that you were not aware because I was able to speak with you after it was impounded elsewhere. XXXX ( id # XXXX ) at Capital one said that insurance dragged their feet, so they had to secure their interest. I asked why no one called me. She said that she would check to see if they did. I said if they did, they needed to leave a voicemail, and they did not. She said they were not required to. It would have been a courtesy call. I am filing a complaint with the State Attorney at this point. This is so unfair. XXXX XXXX Call received from Ms. XXXX. I explained my conversations with Capital One. She was going to speak with her supervisor. I filed a complaint on XXXX XXXX with the Florida State Attorney General. Call received from insurance, and they will write a check for the total. I must pick up the check and put it in my checking account. Then call Capital One with the debit card and pay the fees. The insurance is adding it to the amount of the claim. I checked my mail to see if I received any notices from yesterday around 3 pm. the box was empty. XX/XX/XXXX I checked my mail this morning. Yesterday 's mail was there. I received my certified notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. I saw that the Postal Carrier initialed and dated when he or she first brought the letter, when they received my signed notice back, and when the letter would be returned to XXXX XXXX   XXXX. I also received a notice from Capital One dated XX/XX/XXXX. Upon reading both notices, I discovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX sent their notice to all entities involved, so I guess they operate under a first-come, first-serve basis. I see they quote Florida Statutes stating they can sell the vehicle after 35 days. Capital One picked up the car sometime after the appraiser appraised the car on XX/XX/XXXX and before XX/XX/XXXX when I discovered the car was missing. The notice Capital One Provided came after the date of picking up the vehicle as it is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX, thinking they would apologize ; instead, they are holding the car hostage requiring fees. I say they are using unfair practices, and because they are a big company, they think they can push me ( their own customer ) around. I expect it from the towing company, but not from my finance company when I followed the rules. I apologize for this long complaint, but I have had a lot going on between these companies. At this time, my insurance company has provided a check for the fees, and we ( myself and the insurance company ) are unsure if the car is even repairable. In the end, I will still probably be held responsible for everything. I will attach everything I can for your review. I thank you in advance for your assistance.equifax has fail to provide company of my credit history or not accurate information. The creditor i use are not able to access my equifax credit report called several times to get this resolve and nobody seems to know what they are doing. Creditors are pulling fruad alerts or freeze and getting nothingAccounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the " would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX  P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..My card was closed by the company. I ended up paying off my card in order to delete from my credit report. Not only are the late payments still showing but the account overall was n't deleted. It 's making it difficult for me to obtain large purchases due to this. I need this to be removed as I was doing a pay to delete when I spoke to a rep.Oportun has done it again. Other than harrasing my friends, family and myself. Which when applying for the loan claim they will be refrences to see if you are qualified for the loan, but which is not true as they just harass my refrences. They have now taken it upon a low income family to charge me twice in a single pay period. Regardless of the situation I am in. I am a XXXX  woman with one income which I have explained to them over and over again. They question me every single time about this issue whenthey call which is about 5 times a month. They say they have all calls on file yet they can not show proof of this on demand. My request to contest the double payment was just shrugged off and was told it would take tleast 10 days to process. All while which being told I had authorized this payment. The whole time during this I felt as if they were trying to get me to verbally admit I had made given the authorization for the payments on back to back days. Why would I just not schedule a higher payment on the same day? If I would have had the money I would have done that. I spoke to Agent XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX where he confirmed they would automatically withdraw a payment of {$83.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which is as XXXX the agent stated my regularly scheduled payments. This was not done. Instead I recieved a call from my father in XX/XX/XXXX stating that agents from opportun has been harrassing him for my debt. Two days after my scheduled payment. I shortly called opportun after to see why they were harrassing my father. When I was transfred to an agent XXXX XXXX. He was very confusing and I felt harassed and pressured I even cried in the phone. telling me I had to make two payments on back to back days after I was told something else. He took it down a notch and apologized and asked me if I could authorize the payment on the XXXX. So I did he let me know this payment would appear deducted on XX/XX/XXXX. Once again I left it at that. Today XX/XX/XXXX I checked my statements as I got a notification that my account was overdrawn. To my surprise Opportun has withdrawn a payment of {$91.00} out of my account on the XXXX and one of XXXX on the XXXX. When I call to ask why they just keep stating that I have authorized 2 payments back to back. Which I can not be clearer I did not. They keep stating I did and that it will take 10-15 days to just review my claim. I dont not have 10-15 days at a negative account balance my accounts will be frozen and my husbands checks will not be deposited. Today I spoke XXXX XXXX agent and her supervisor XXXX XXXX. Both of which as I stated before tried to bully me into saying I authorized both payments. I can not stress enough how poorly regulated this company is as most of their customers are immigrants or low income families. Being in both of those brackets I can assure you that other relatives and friends have experienced the same issues with this companies. With them being one of the only accessible compones to immigrants I feel they get away with a lot for immigrants shy away from spotlights and reporting them in fear of what might happen to them. I hope you take my compliant seriously and investigate this company further and like I said I dont not feel as if they are regulated properly and they harrass people excessively.i got title loan on my XXXX XXXX XXXX, valued at XXXX for XXXX/XXXX! from the jump i had problems with the almost XXXX XXXX payment but i tried! the first time i had a check for XXXX mailed, thats when i learned they dont take checks! then i tried to bring in XXXX cash and expained i had to wait for the rest of the cash from the check! thats when they stated they did not take partial payments! at this point im behind and can never catch up cause they dont take partial payments. so the van got repo and im not fighting it! my problem is i owe more with them having my car then where i started! my van was valued at XXXX and they only sold it for XXXX XXXX leaving me a balance of XXXX.. which mean i just gave them my car and owe more for the car!!! thats some bull ... and doesnt even make sense or like they was really trying 2 recover this money cause they knew they would continue to collect from me! they could have let me keep my van if selling it was going to keep me in debt!I received a notice of an outstanding debt I forgot to pay when I moved in XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called American Capital. The number was not in service. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX a weekday and it worked. I spoke to XXXX, the person on the notice, and requested he investigate the debt as I thought it was paid. He said he would do so and call me back. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again and left a message for XXXX as I had not heard from him. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and left another message for XXXX. Between XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I received at least 3 phone messages from someone named XXXX saying he was returning my call. I never called someone named XXXX. After the 3rd or 4th such message, I called back, asked the secretary if she could tell me why this person was calling me, she refused to do so despite multiple queries, she refused to tell me what their company did and put me on hold. XXXX answered the phone and immediately began YELLING at me about how I was making him look bad by lying about the number of times I left messages for him, demanding I send him copies of my cell phone bills, and telling me I should n't lie and make him look bad. I asked him to stop yelling and he responded, " This is n't yelling, lady. You 'll know when I 'm yelling at you. '' I continued for at least 3 minutes attempting to get him to tell me who he was, why he was calling, what he wanted, etc. He finally told me he was calling about " a personal matter ''. At no point in time did he tell me he was calling about a debt or was from the collection agency. He proceeded to lecture me for 2 minutes on how I should n't cause him so much trouble at work ( while still yelling ), how awful I was treating him on the phone ( when I could n't even get in a word edge wise ). I finally asked if he was calling about the debt owed to the City of XXXX and he patronizingly said, " Why, yes, XXXX, why on earth would I be wasting my time on you? '' I explained that in my line of work I made many phone calls and left messages for people so having that information at the start of the conversation would have been helpful so I knew who he was and what he was calling about. Keep in mind that AT NO POINT had I ever left a message for this person, only for XXXX. At no point did XXXX ever state he was calling on behalf of XXXX or a collections agency. He only said American Capital which, without the notice in front of me, I had no idea what that was- it could have been a solicitor for all I knew.I asked him how I could pay the debt. He told me the amount. I asked him again how I could pay the debt and he said by check or by phone. I said fine, I would pay it by credit card via phone. He said he was going to transfer me to someone else. When I asked for clarification on who that would be, he sighed condescendingly and began lecturing me as if I was a naughty two year old. I hung up. I still do n't know if this person even works for the debt collection company. All I know is it was a humiliating, unnecessary situation. I have yet to be provided with anything verifying the debt itself despite my request, just a letter from American Capital saying I owe the debt. I have never been treated so poorly or rudely, much less been yelled at from the start of and throughout a phone call. XXXX never told me I could pay online ( which I did ). I was shaking when I got off the phone. I tried to reason with him, tried being polite, never raised my voice once, yet he was belligerent, condescending and abusive. He should be fired and this company should be put out of business. XXXX was perfectly nice and helpful when I spoke to him. I still have no idea why this XXXX person called me or what happened to my messages to XXXX. That was never explained. Instead, I was verbally abused with the implication being I was a stupid woman.I purchased a product from a vendor for about {$1300.00} The product was delivered not to my specs and was unuseable. I returned the product to the vendor and they fixed their mistakes. A couple of weeks later I looked at my credit card statement and the vendor had charged my credit card {$990.00} without my permission, without notifying me and without providing me a bill. I called the vendor to try to resolve with no success " they might work with me '' but I never received any further correspondence. I called the credit card company to put the charge in dispute, they did put the charge in dispute and removed it from my bill. Then about a month later I got a form letter in the mail from the credit card company saying they could not verify a billing error and they were reposting the charge to my account which they did. In my letter I specifically instructed the credit card company not to pay this charge. If the vendor wants to come after me for the money then that 's between me and them. The credit card company is not the decision maker of where and how I spend my money and just because the vendor has my card number on file does n't give them the right to charge any amount they want, when they want.My mortgage company is stating I 'm behind on my account. Per my calculations I should be up to date. They have applied my monthly payment towards other fees without my authorization, this cause for my account to be at default assessing late charges on the account and reporting over 30days past due. Until this date, I have requested for someone to review my account and explain to me how my funds are being distribute to my account. I get no answer, representative only state " I will mail you out a payment history report '' this is not the solution. I need answer. I requested to speak to a Supervisor and was told her name was XXXX she was unprofessional. I asked her to please go over payment history report with me to inform me where in my part I defaulted on my loan. I 'm 100 % sure my account should not be past due. I need assistance and need someone to inform me where I defaulted and no one in this company is taking the time to review my account to proof them wrong.. I expect my credit report to be fixed and my account back up to date.Sometime several years ago I began getting statements from Pay Pal Credit and was shocked since I don't pay via pay pal when I order on Amazon.com. I filed a complaint against Pay Pal Credit and soon realized there had been numerous complaints lodged against the entity by thousands of American citizens and the Federal Gov't sued for opening up credit accounts on people without their permission or knowledge. Pay Pal Credit even accessed my personal credit history without my knowledge. I thought the problem had been rectified, but now as of a few weeks ago, I received a letter from Synchrony Bank stating they are taking over my Pay Pal credit line. The letter states Revised Terms as of XX/XX/2019. I don't even use PP Credit. I have a XXXX and an Amazon Store Card and those are the only cards I use to pay for Amazon purchases as those cards generate points that I can redeem for cash. How do I stop this? I don't even know what the account number is other than XXXX. I am afraid that someone phishing could steal my identity and run up a Pay Pal Bill in my name. I've already had my data breached via an online nursing continuing education website and my credit is being monitored by XXXX XXXX services for the next year. After that, I do not know what could happen.i was supposed to close on my home on XX/XX/2016 just to find out that i was not able to do to the fact that the special warranty deed was not completed from Pennymac to HUD ...

How could something so simple have me and my children facing being homeless. Ive begg this company to respond ive called all day and been passed around.

Then the CSR responded well I dont care what your excuses are I need the payment and I need it now. I told her I could make the payment but until Friday. She said she couldnt wait and needed now. I told her all I could do was Friday and that I had to hang up cause I had to go back to work. She then replied well Im going to call your work to speak to you. I worked at a XXXX XXXX and I had already asked her several times to stop calling me at work. She called me the next day at work and I again told her couldnt make the payment and that I had asked to stop calling me at work because I was going to get fired. The initial call was on a Monday and she kept on calling my work all the way through Thursday on Friday when I was going to give a payment she told me it was a higher amount and hat I didnt have and she couldnt accept the lower amount. This person started calling the whole world to tell them to ask me to pay my loan and gave out information about my loan dates taken out amounts days I was past due and all the details. I spoke to her and told her that what she was doing was wrong and that I was just goIng to wait until the loan was charged off so that I could pay off because I didnt want to deal with her anymore. She said she didnt know what if was talking about that I never asked to stop calling ... i was fired from my job due to the many calls she made to work and now Ill really dont have a job to pay them back withI opened an account with XXXX There was a third party credit check applied 6 months into my agreement that was sent through mail to inform me of identity theft though XXXX use of my informationIn XX/XX/2018, I contacted XXXX to make automatic payments- I gave them the correct bank account number but the customer rep did not repeat it back to me. Apparently they got the wrong account number and didnt get to process the payment. In XXXX they reported my account as delinquent to the credit bureau which affected my credit score. They said they would look into the previous phone call but have not contacted me and its been almost a month. They offered no other solutions to help fix the wrong credit reporting they did. Please help.The Mortage company failed to pay off my taxes in XXXX XXXX. I sold my home in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The Mortage company Faye Servcing added on $ XXXX worth of fees on my account. Refused to tell me what they were for. To date the company is refusing to call me back, or follow up with me about my Escrow Refund of almost {$1000.00} I call them almost everyday for the last two months and only thing they said was the check should went out XXXX XXXX, XXXX but its just sitting there we will follow up within 48 hours and get the refund out to you. Now overtime I call they tell me they have to transfer my to my old rep or a supervisor who I also spoken with in beginning of XXXX who both stated they would get back with me within 48 and to date no money no refund. This company needs to be sued and I am further turning to over to an attorney for results and the way that I was and have been treated unfairly and violation of federal laws they have. broken to me. property address XXXX XXXX ga XXXX My account manager is very rude and sarcastic with me when I call. They just dont give a careThis collection agency has placed a negative trade line on my credit reports indicating I owe them, or the original creditor they represent, money. I have not received any notices in the mail regarding this account nor was I given the opportunity to dispute the validity of the debt. Once this trade line appeared on my credit reports, I sent a certified letter to this collection agency requesting validation of debt. I have received no response. I sent another certified letter to them informing them I intend to sue for violating my rights under the FDCPA. I still have not received a response. The trade lines are continuing to appear on my credit reports even after I have presented the letters to the credit bureaus. Collection activity continues to occur after I requested validation. The lack of action and/or response by this collection agency demonstrates noncompliance with section 809 of the FDCPA.I have 2 hard inquiries that I did not authorise on my transunion credit report. Both of them are from XXXX and they are inquired on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2019. One of the inquires I found out provided a phone number which is not mine. The number is XXXX. I have now deleted that number from my transunion account. I called transunion on XX/XX/2019 about this and they asked me to call XXXX for letter of deletion, but XXXX can not provide me with the letter since I dont have an account with them. Transunion told me they can not dispute those 2 hard inquiries without the letter.Navient is my loan servicer. I paid over {$500.00} a month on my student loans like clock work ( using autopay ) for over 14 years because I had a good job which allowed me to make the payments with no problem. Unfortunately, after being with the same company for over almost 11 years, I was let go due to the company relocating to California. I continued to pay as long as I could, but then wasn't able to. I called Navient to try and work out a payment plan I could afford and was given no affordable options. I had savings, and was hoping to negotiate a payoff amount. I was told absolutely not an option. I warned if they couldn't work anything out for me that I could afford, and they couldn't negotiate a payoff amount that I'd no longer be able to pay on my loans. They said sorry, nothing we can do. I then HAD to stop paying because I literally couldn't afford it anymore. I am now being sued for defaulting. I still have no job because I haven't been able to find a job that would pay enough to afford child care. Everything I have found would be working just to pay for child care, which defeats the purpose of working at that point. I can't afford a lawyer so I am left with no options at this point. It is very frustrating because I feel like they should have worked with me back when I called countless times to explain my situation. Things didn't have to come to this ... negotiating payments or a payoff amount would have been much more beneficial to both parties. My credit, which was near perfect before this disaster, is totally destroyed. There is a reason there is countless lawsuits against Navient. I had paid the amount I borrowed before all this ... I was only paying the unbelievable amount of interest that was attached to the loans.I had submitted my loan modification package to chase back in XXXX 2017. Until today I do n't have an answer of denial or approval. We had submitted all documentation required for the loan modification. and I just never get a chance to speak with someone. Always answering machines and rudeness customer service rep. Chase had changed our relationship manager over ten times so we ca n't never had a clear communication with anyone. Everytime a new relationship manager changes the story changes and we starting all over again. We are exhausted with the discrimination of background that we are receiving. I 'm XXXX and I feel discriminated and thus why Chase does what it does. My account with chase is clean, never defaulted and long time customer but chase seems that it 's ok for them to discriminate based on my background. I 'm reaching up to the authorities to investigate this discrimination issue and I will be contacting an attorney based on this issue. We are seeking a principal reduction so we can pay off the loan. I do n't have a job, I 'm sick with XXXX XXXX and I ca n't just take more headache from a company that does n't care about their loyal customers. So please help.I had a transaction with Remitly last XXXX XXXX amount {$2500.00} USD via express delivery and it should only take 10 minutes but I waited for 12 hours- 24hours to 3 days and more but was n't able to send the money to my recipient. They emailed me XXXX XXXX saying they 're taking a second look at my transaction after asking for inquiry why it takes a long time. After 12 hours of waiting, I decided to cancel my transaction and received an email confirmation " The charge to my card was voided and will be reflected in my account balance by the end of the day ''. So I waited but my refund was not reflected back to my account balance. XXXX XXXX I spoke to customer service of my " bank '' and stated they are waiting for the receipt of cancellation from Remitly so I can get my refund back to my account balance. Right after my conversation with my bank I called and emailed Remitly and they are asking for the ff : details ( name of bank, bank 's email, name of bank contact person/department ) I emailed back that I do n't know and it 's not my job to send the " Authorization Hold Removal request from my bank in order for them to release the pending charge. '' This is very disappointing because I have the right to cancel my transaction and refund back my money as I do need it immediately. I tried my best to get in touch with them and do my work but still, I do n't know what 's going on and they 're not giving the right customer services. Thank you so much.Dear Sir and/or Madame : As a senior citizen, I would expect not to be taken advantage of especially with something as serious as a mortgage. I have as of yet to be given an accurate, ongoing accounting of my mortgage loan. When I have asked questions, I have been given incorrect and/or incomplete information. " The year 's end analysis '', I was told would clear up all my questions. It has not. Please help with the following : I was initially informed that the mortgage insurance would be stopped after a few months Itemization of Amount Financed / Settlement Statement Return of the per dieum I was erroneously charged The money I returned from FHA repairs Insurances cancellation and accounting for XXXX Bank - accounting, request for loan payment in full XXXX. - accounting, letter of transfer XXXX - accounting Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Corporation - accountingI did not apply to the following places for a vehicle. I have contacted each one and they said they can't do anything about it, and they blow me off like it's my problem, when they are the ones who looked up my credit. But it shows a negative on my credit report because all these finance companies checked my credit report. I don't live in XXXX. The only two states I have lived in for the last 30 years is XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I have not looked for a car finance company at all. If I did, I would go straight to XXXX, where I know I can get it financed. XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXXSince the beginning of my loan I was making payments towards interests for my loan with  XXXX . Later we had a mishap with my credit card and this led to me finding out that my payments were n't going towards the interst as originally planned with them. They charged me interest on top of interest and finally when I get ahold of them they told me  XXXX   and Navient had split up and they split my payments without me knowing and my   XXXX   account was being paid. This led to a drop in my credit and huge increase in student loan. I have managed to settle with   XXXX   but I 'm still paying high interest with Navient due to this. I was never informed or contacted of this situation or these event occurring.I have disputed this debt numerous times with no removal from XXXX. This account was from my ex wife child and not mine. I was told through XXXX that Credit Consulting Service said it was mine. The check written to the original debtor even shows someones name, not mine. Account # XXXX. This account was also granted to my ex through the divorce court. I have sent all documents to XXXX and the creditor and have had no luck. Company : CCS Date : XX/XX/2013 Please help. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXXXXXX is in violation of FCRA, FDCPA and XXXX XXXX Compliance.I contacted PennyMac mortgage for deed in lieu in XXXX of XXXX. My home in Alabama had been on the market since XXXX of XXXX ( now over 28 months ), I suffered job loss in XXXX of XXXX and moved to Texas for employment in XXXX of XXXX. The home is located in an economically depressed area and I have not been able to sell. Before I could be considered for deed in lieu I was told by PennyMac that I first had to apply for modification ( denied in XXXX of XXXX ). I was then told that I had to apply for a short sale before I could be considered for a deed in lieu. Both the deed in lieu and short sale were denied in XXXX of XXXX based upon their XXXX XXXX appraisal. However I continued my attempts to avoid foreclosure by listing the home which failed inspection by a potential buyer in XXXX XXXX which I provided to PennyMac. I subsequently obtained my own appraisal in XXXX XXXX which the PennyMac refused to consider because it was substantially lower than that obtained by PennyMac in XXXX XXXX. After another purchaser presented, PennyMac refused to consider a short sale and finally repeated their appraisal which still is considerably higher than the market will bear. I had contacted HUD who suggested that I undergo credit counseling which I did. Both HUD representatives and the XXXX credit counseling agency were concerned regarding my experience with PennyMac and apparently mine is not an isolated incidence. I currently have a buyer ( short sale ) however while PennyMac has finally decided to present my file to HUD, they are not being forthcoming regarding information required from me and although this information has been previously provided, I am concerned that " lack of information/compliance '' will be used as a means to terminate the short sale and proceed with foreclosure which is now scheduled for XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I am in disbelief that PennyMac maintains the position that foreclosure is a better financial alternative to a short sale. My credit has been significantly and adversely affected by PennyMac 's commitment to proceeding with foreclosure as the representative has also refused to intervene and place these proceedings on hold.On XX/XX/2019 I thought I was making a purchase safely through my banking mobile account but it went through XXXX and I later found out the company was fraudulent. Company website XXXX ( XXXX ) has been suspended. I lost {$490.00} through XXXX and called Wells Fargo to file a complaint and was told that they cant get my money back because the transaction was completed! Please help me, I thought I was making a safe transaction but it was a scam!I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. It has been months and I still have not received a response to my concerns. The only thing I have received is some automated rejection letter stating that they wo n't do anything to help me. This has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I 've already wasted so much time just trying to get Experian to look at the errors on my credit report and I 'm so frustrated that Experian is intentionally not responding to my inquiries. I need to have this issue resolved immediately. There are many things I need to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I am not able to move forward all because of this credit bureau!In or around XXXX XXXX I was laid off and soon thereafter began having financial hardship. I explained this situation to Car Finance ( the agency collecting the auto loan ) of such hardship. Towards the end of XXXX XXXX my income was drastically decreased but I kept my best to make payments and ask that they stop calling my cell phone so often as I was well aware of the times my payments were late but I was still making them. In XXXX XXXX they kept calling on a regular basis even though I explained I was trying to borrow funds and would make sure my payments were n't more than 30 days past due. My requests continued to fall on deaf ears and the calls had gotten to the point I begged to stop and borrowed money from my roommate on credit to pay my bill, because they would n't let me off the phone. I have spoken to people in the legal field because of the harassment and I was advised once I asked them to stop calling my cell phone they would be in violation of the Telephone Collection Practices Act and considering they had called at times prior to XXXX and after XXXX PST they were violating Federal Collection Practices Act. I called them and told them about these violations and I NEEDED them to stop ; i was told ( no less than two separate occasions ) they could n't until my bill was up to date. -- I have made several complaints to them, I 'll need to get their call logs because their number changes and I only have two or three numbers they used to call me on my cell phone call logs. I understand that an attorney may assist in getting direct funds for each violation. My goal is not to have an attorney take a lot of money and I still owe them. My goal is to have them work with me, remove all of the fees ( which is the majority of the amount owed ) and a decent payment plan only on the remaining principal amount. That seems fair, I do n't want a long drawn out legal issue and them to threaten to repossess my vehicle while ruining my credit report. My credit report should n't have any delinquencies regarding this debt because I have made sure payments were not over thirty days.There is a {$3500.00} charge to a line of credit at Santander Bank which I never authorized with my name on it. I disputed this and my  dispute was denied. I have never received any Bill 's yet my credit score is being negatively affected. I did not take this money and I should not have to be held responsible. What can I do.Experian will not remove persistent dispute remarks on my EXPERIAN credit report, They are holding my credit hostage, I am applyling for an home loan. I have 5 days for the bank to underwrite my loan. I can not get a home loan with persistent dispute remarks. They will not approve my loan with these remarks on my credit. I disputed these accounts over 30 days ago and received an email from Experian showing that my dispute was complete. their way of handing customer service issues is wrong. They are showing MY XXXX XXXX funding accounts starting in # XXXX and # XXXX PENDING until XX/XX/2016. That date is way past 30 days and yet, Experian claimed that my dispute was complete on XX/XX/2016.THis is a confusing and very misleading way of communication in the investigation results. I have exhausted myself XXXX with Experian trying to remove these remarks. From the initial date of my dispute to now it has caused me XXXX..My work performance has been affected as well as my home life. Experian refuses to remove these dispute remarks on XXXX of my XXXX accounts as well as my XXXX account, # XXXX and XXXX account # XXXX these all have dispute remarks. Experian is holding my credit XXXX by persistent dispute remarks on these accounts. They are holing me hostage to these remarks by not allowing me to get a home loan. I have been informed by my Mortgage, company that they can not underwrite loans that have dispute remarks. I have requested that they remove these persistent remarks and Experian refuses, XXXX and XXXX did so in 24-48 hours for me. This is so frustrating and taxing on my life and family. MY mortgage company said I may loose my down payment on a home. They are preventing my underwriter to take the next step. Once again, it is my XXXX accounts I mentioned, I need these persistent remarks removed that are past 30 day from first initial dispute. PLEASE HELP have these removed as soon as possible.MY credit and home life is being held hostage to these remarks.I did not authorize the following inquiries that are listed on my credit report.

At the time I was told by another debt collection agency that the account would be canceled and sent back to XXXX XXXX. Now, AFNI has received the XXXX assignment again and they have illegaly credit reported this to my credit reports. I am in the middle of financing a home and this is causing me significant damages if it does not get resolved IMMEDIATELY. I have a police report and fraud affadavit that has this account listed as a fraudulently opened account and demand this item be removed from my credit report. Should I suffer any damages from AFNI 's willfull negligence in credit reporting this I will hold them liable for everything I will lose including my earnest money deposit and less than prime financing terms that they are going to be causing me.XX/XX/2016 I opened a checking account with Citi Bank NA. As part of the new account bonus, Citi Bank offered XXXX bonus if I meet criteria to earn the XXXX dollar bonus. I did meet their criteria in same month. Furthermore, to get the XXXX bonus the consumer must wait 90 days to receive the bonus which was fulfilled as well. I visited the branch and requested status of the XXXX. The branch was willing to help but the back office of Citi Bank does not want to fulfill their side of the obligation. They made an agreement to give me the bonus after meeting the criteria but not willing to do so as we speak. I have to constantly follow up for this to no avail as of this date. At a minimum, this is a deceptive marketing gimmick by Citibank and I seek relief from this scam by Citi Bank and like the XXXX I was promised.Chase offers Price Protection coverage. Upon submitting claims, the processor 's claims staff look for invented reasons to deny claims and use shifting reasons for denial such as : the words " Add to cart '' being cut off ; a copy of physical catalog which shows the available sizes and color inadequately showing which size was " selected, '' something impossible with a physical catalog ; the computer taskbar time not being legible despite the submission also showing XXXX 's stated time, date, and location when searching " time '' ( the claims staff state that only taskbar time is accepted despite that not being in the program terms and a system clock being easily edited compared to XXXX 's clock ). It appears that the processor exploits its discretion to invent reasons to request additional information from consumers. It knows that most consumers won't follow-up or can't capture the missing information because the competitive sale offering has already ended. Then after 60 days the claim can be denied for lack of the consumer following up timely to hide the nonsense reasons that led to the claim denial in the first instance. Effectively, this is a consumer fraud because the processor could detail all the information it requires in advance but instead relies on after-the-fact discretion. Further, the processor knows that there are finite pixels on a computer screen and there is only so much information a consumer can capture on a screenshot when webpages are designed for scrolling and information is not clearly requested in advance. Similarly, print catalogs only contain so much information. Ultimately, Chase offers a " benefit '' it knows it will not have to pay on. Chase intentionally uses a claims processor instead of an insurer so that the entity is not licensed by and accountable to any state insurance regulator. The insurance underwriter isnt processing the claims. CFPB is the only avenue for  consumers to get help. I spoke with customer service ( XXXX ), a supervisor ( XXXX ), and a manager ( XXXX ). The claims review staff argued many of these points with the manager who himself didnt seem to agree, but is obliged to yield to the XXXXlaims Examiner Management Team. I claimed claim numbers : XXXX ( {$7.00} - approved ), XXXX ( {$22.00}, increased to {$38.00} ), XXXX ( {$17.00} ), XXXX ( {$4.00}, increased to {$19.00} ), XXXX ( {$20.00} ), XXXX ( {$42.00} ). I will submit additional claims information if necessary. In total, accounting for increased claims, I claimed {$140.00} of which {$7.00} was approved. I request Chase be made to pay me the {$130.00} on these valid, unpaid claims. CFPB should investigate this program as it seems Im not the only consumer who has experienced nonsense reasons for denials and CFBP complaints have been filed by other Chase customers.On XX/XX/XXXX I sent Trans Union and XXXX a Certified Letter About Unauthorized Inquiries On My Credit Report.

Per Federal reporting regulations and the MANDATED COMPLIANT Metro 2 format reporting standards of practice any and all items of adversary or derogatory nature must be certified as entirely true, accurate, complete, timely, of documented ownership, of undoubted responsibility, and documented testimonial certificate of compliance marking undeniable lawful standing of claim ( s ). Per law, any deficient of substantial and evident matters of fact ( s ) would be unethically reported  and even illegally reported. My state and the federal laws alike agree that neither willful nor ignorant disregard is acceptable, so I demand here today, even RIGHT NOW, that the allegation in challenge be eradicated in full or else wise demonstrated in it's entirety to be compliant in every aspect of its reporting. To retain much less report otherwise would be a vile misrepresentation and done so in unlawful and injurious infraction of mandated compliance laws. The currently unfounded and even not certified true or correct misinformation of which is misreporting is attached to this complaint and must be deleted immediately, so please do so without delay. I have attempted to resolve the issue directly with the respective parties, however found that they were non-compliant as per the FCRA and CDIA requirementsThe credit bureau will not perform a proper investigation nor will they delete inaccurate personal information from my credit reports after all documentation has been sent to them. The courts verified with me via the phone that the liens and the judgments are not verified with the credit bureaus. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 611 part B subsection iii, they are supposed to verify with the source of the information which they are providing me but apparently that is not what is going on. I asked for the following : 1. Did you speak directly to any agent of the company that was reporting the information to confirm the accuracy of what you are reporting? 2 Please explain to me what your representatives uncovered to lead them to believe that you are reporting this item as it legally should be reported? 3. What certified documents were reviewed to conclude your investigation? 4. Please provide a complete copy of all of the information that was transmitted to the data furnisher as part of the investigation. 5. What did it cost your company to obtain the documents needed to complete your investigation? 6. Please provide proof of your timely procurement of certified documents.
